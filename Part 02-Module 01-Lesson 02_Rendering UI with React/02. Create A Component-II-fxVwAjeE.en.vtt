00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
React provides a base component class that we can use to

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.589
group many elements together and use them as if they were one element.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.629
You could think about React components as

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.855
the factories that we use to create React elements.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:16.004
So, by building custom components or classes,

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.660
we can easily generate our own custom elements.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.199
So, I'm going to create a new class.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.004
I will call it my ContactList and I'm going to extend React.Component.

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.765
Now, the only method that is actually required in a class is called a render.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:41.395
And it renders job to return the GSX or the elements that this component renders.

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:43.835
So, when we render a contact list,

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:49.799
what we're going to render is this entire OL and all of the list items inside of it.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.809
Now, instead of rendering this element,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.210
we will render our contact list element instead.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.980
So, by grouping together all of these elements into a single component,

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.529
we could render them and treat them as if they were a single element.
