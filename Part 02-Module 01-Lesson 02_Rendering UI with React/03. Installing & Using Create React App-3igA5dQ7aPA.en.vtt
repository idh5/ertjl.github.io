00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
So now, let's install create-react-app,

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:05.580
and use it to create our first React application.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.855
We'll use npm install dash g, create-react-app,

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:16.065
npm install goes and grabs the create-react-app package from the npm registry.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.365
The dash g flag makes sure it's installed globally,

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:24.754
so we have the create-react-app command available in our terminal.

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:27.234
So we're going to say, create-react-app,

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:30.489
and we'll create an app called Contacts to

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.039
display the JSX that we've been working on up until this point.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.475
Now, create-react-app installs react,

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:41.469
react-dom which we've already seen and also this react-scripts package.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.509
React-scripts encapsulates a lot of powerful libraries.

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:51.429
It installs Babel so we can use the latest JavaScript syntax as well as JSX.

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.185
It also installs Webpack,

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:57.175
so we can generate the build and it installs Webpack dev server,

00:00:57.174 --> 00:01:01.434
which gives us the auto-reload behavior we've seen up until this point.

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.460
As with all abstractions,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.519
you can peel back the layers on react-scripts one at a time,

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:09.129
if you really want to see what's under the hood.

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:13.449
But for now, create-react-app is a great way to get started quickly with

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.105
the latest technologies without having to put in

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:20.340
all the time needed to learn them before you get started with React.
