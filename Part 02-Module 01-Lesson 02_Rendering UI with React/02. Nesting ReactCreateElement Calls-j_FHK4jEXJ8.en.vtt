00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
Now, let's talk about nesting.

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.629
Most user interfaces are represented as views inside other views.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.275
And since react is a library for creating user interfaces,

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:12.560
it's actually really good at this.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.304
So, let's take this div and instead of just saying,

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:19.559
"Hello world", let's put some other elements inside.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.714
Maybe we can put a span inside of here to hold our message,

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:27.179
or a strong element so that it's bold.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.910
So, we can nest elements inside other elements just by

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.950
passing them as this third argument to create element.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.100
Now, let's do something a little more interesting.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.660
Let's create a list.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.434
So this is going to be a list item,

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:42.885
this first item will be Tyler.

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:45.210
So, we're going to create a list of people.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.225
The second one will be Karen.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:52.160
And then finally, we will have Richard.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.424
So, now what we've done is using create element,

00:00:55.424 --> 00:00:58.559
we have created a list of people.
