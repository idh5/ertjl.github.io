Using JSX in our javascript code makes it significantly more readable.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:07.205
However, it does require a build step,

00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:09.655
which is something you might have not done before.

00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:12.959
Basically, we need a compiler to take our GSX code and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.390
compile it down to a real javascript code that we can actually run in the browser.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.018
There are a few popular build tools for web projects,

00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:23.664
but the most widely used in the React ecosystem is Webpack.

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:26.369
We could stop and take a bunch of time to set up Webpack,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.125
but luckily for us,

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:31.440
the developers of Facebook have already done this for us.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.439
Facebook's create-react-app sets up everything we

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:38.000
need to develop and build apps that use React in JSX.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.719
So let's use it.
