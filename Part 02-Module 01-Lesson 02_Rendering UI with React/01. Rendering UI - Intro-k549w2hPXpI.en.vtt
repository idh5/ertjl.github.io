00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
Instead of using a string template,

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:06.449
React uses JavaScript objects to build the user interface.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.265
This is a fundamental difference between React and other popular Javascript frameworks.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.535
React elements this lightweight JavaScript objects,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.515
not actual DOM nodes.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.234
And we get to use the full power of JavaScript to put them together.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:23.364
We use these elements to describe what the page should look like

00:00:23.364 --> 00:00:27.449
and then let React do the hard part of actually manipulating the DOM.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.734
We can even create our own custom elements called components,

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:35.375
that we can use to neatly encapsulate groups of elements and behavior.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.024
These components are the building blocks of React.

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:40.899
So, let's get started and create some elements.
