You can both develop your entire in your Workspace as well as submit your project to be reviewed. For more information about your Workspace, check out the Your Project Workspace page.\n\nIf you'd like to work locally on your own computer, fork and clone the [starter repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).\n\nThe code in both your Workspace and the starter repo contains all the CSS and HTML markup that may be used but omits the React code that is required to complete the project. This can save you some time if you don't wish to write all the CSS and HTML from scratch. The provided code will demonstrate a static HTML page of the finished application, but with no interactive functionality. \n\n### Starting from Scratch\n\nIf you'd like to start completely from scratch, you can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to create a new React application. However, even if you create your own application from scratch you'll still need to use the [`booksAPI.js` file](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/src/BooksAPI.js) that comes with the starter template to interact with the backend API. Instructions for using the API methods are provided in the `README` in the starter template repository.\n",
