00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
When I was younger and a test was coming up,

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:07.175
I'd make flashcards to help me memorize important information for the test.

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:10.625
The project that you're going to be building is a mobile flashcard app.

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:13.980
In the app, a user will be able to create a flashcard.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.960
The front part of the flashcard displays

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.020
the question and the back part displays the answer.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.605
The user will be able to group flashcards together in decks.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.080
These will also be able to quiz themselves on

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.390
a deck and receive a score once they finished.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.100
Check in the following sections for

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.740
the specific details on how the app needs to function.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
