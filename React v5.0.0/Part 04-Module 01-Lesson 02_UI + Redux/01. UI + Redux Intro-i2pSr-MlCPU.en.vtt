00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.635
In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.200
we learned how to improve the predictability of the state in

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.875
our application by building our own state management library.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:12.719
In this lesson, we'll take that state management library and add some UI to it.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.179
This will allow us to take a closer look at how

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.070
our custom library can manage the state of an actual application.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
