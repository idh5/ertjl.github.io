00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.169
At this point, you may be getting a little concerned.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.468
This course is supposed to teach you Redux,

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:07.350
but we haven't even mentioned it yet.

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:08.687
Here's the good news,

00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:14.449
we've essentially created our own version of Redux that follows the Redux API exactly.

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.679
Just like the library we built ourselves,

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.699
Redux has a state management library that has a store, actions, and reducers.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.184
Let's go ahead and replace our own implementation with the real Redux,

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:27.439
so you can see just how similar they are.
