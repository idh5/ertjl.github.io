00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
As of right now, everything is in a single JavaScript file.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:08.759
But now what we want to do, is we want to start adding some UI to our application.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.619
So in order to do that, what we'll do,

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:15.091
is let's make a new file here called index.html.

00:00:15.092 --> 00:00:18.609
This will just have the basic skeleton.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.440
So now, we'll give this a title of let's just say,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.310
let's say Udacity Todos Goals.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.299
And now what we're going to do, is inside of our body,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:39.457
let's have a script tag here with a type of text/javascript.

00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:43.359
And then as you can probably guess, what we're going to do,

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:50.200
is we're going to take all of our JavaScript in our index.html or index.gs file,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.155
and we are going to just paste it inside of our script tag here.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.640
So we're going old school with the script tags.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.310
I'm just going to indent all of this.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.445
And then now, if we open up this app in the browser,

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:11.119
you'll notice here we don't have anything on the view because we haven't added anything.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.969
But if we look inside of our Console,

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.609
we're still getting all of our console.logs here.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.504
So now, the only other thing I want to do in this video,

00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:21.594
is now, we've moved over all of our JavaScript.

00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:25.584
Let's go ahead and delete now our index.gs file because again,

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:30.789
all of that logic is living inside of our index.html file,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.620
inside of this script tag.
