00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Now that we have our simple UI here,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.609
the next thing we want to do is make it so the user can add

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.320
new Todo items as well as new goals from the UI itself.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.910
So the first thing we're going to do,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.629
is let's go in here and just comment out all of these dispatch invocations.

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:19.349
So that way the only way that we are updating the state of

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.945
the store is from the UI as I just barely mentioned.

00:00:22.945 --> 00:00:24.089
But we want to keep these around,

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.489
just so we can reference them a little bit later when

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.250
we do start dispatching things from the UI.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.350
Now, the first thing we're going to do is make

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.700
two different functions that are hooked up to both of our buttons here.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.141
So our Add Todo button as well as our Add Goal button.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.254
So what these functions will be called, very fittingly,

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:44.475
we will have an addTodo function,

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:48.700
and then we will make an addGoal function.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.280
So let's start off with addTodo.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.050
The very first thing we want to do,

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.574
is we want to grab the value of this input field here.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:58.420
So if you remember,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.215
what we did was we gave this input an Id of Todo.

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:09.640
So first thing we want to do is just grab the input by saying, document.getElementById,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:19.920
and then we want to grab the name or the value in the input field by doing input.value.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.120
From there, we want to reset the input value just to an empty string.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.030
And then now we have the name of the new Todo item.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.864
The next thing we want to do is actually dispatch an action.

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:35.159
So if you remember, in order to add a new Todo to our store,

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.644
what we do is we dispatch an action that looks like this.

00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:42.375
Invoking our addTodo action creator,

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:45.314
passing it the Todo item itself.

00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:53.060
So what we'll do here down below is something similar where we can say, store.dispatch.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.195
Now we want to invoke our addTodoAction,

00:01:58.194 --> 00:02:02.894
and then the Todo item itself is going to have three things on it: a name,

00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:06.774
which we have right here it's just the value in the input field.

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:09.555
A complete property which will default to false

00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:12.240
and then an Id and then now what we're going to do

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.585
for Ids is I'm going to head to the top of our JavaScript's code here,

00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:23.115
and just paste in this helper function here called generateId.

00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:24.460
So instead of hard coding the Ids,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.795
we can call this function which we'll go ahead and generate us a unique Id.

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:35.144
So now, Id is just going to be the result of calling generateId.

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:38.495
So now inside of our addGoal function,

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:40.444
we're going to do something similar.

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:43.189
So we will first grab the input field,

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.979
but this time where we're going to get it from is

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:49.744
going to be document.getElementById('goal'),

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:53.295
then we want to grab the name of the goal by doing input.value.

00:02:53.294 --> 00:02:57.959
We want to reset the input value to just be an empty string.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.129
And then now in order to add a new goal to our state,

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.974
what we need to dispatch is the addGoalAction,

00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:08.759
like we did right here.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.804
So what we'll do is we will say

00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:19.125
store.dispatch(addGoalAction( passing it the goal itself which will have an Id.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:22.615
We'll reuse our generate Id function that we created earlier,

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:25.050
then we'll also pass along the name.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.640
So now that we have our addTodo function as well as our addGoal function,

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.919
the next thing we need to do is actually hook them up

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.769
to our buttons so that when these buttons are clicked,

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.115
these functions are invoked.

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:44.094
So we can do that by assigning document.getElementById('todoBtn').

00:03:44.094 --> 00:03:47.550
Because again, if you're a member up here,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.965
this button has an id of 'todoBtn' and this one has an id of 'goalBtn'.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:54.719
So back down at the bottom,

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.594
we grab that button.

00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:02.414
Then from there, we can call addEventListener.

00:04:02.414 --> 00:04:09.629
So when this button is clicked on and we want to invoke the addTodo function right here,

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.810
and then we want to do the exact same thing but for our addGoal functions.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.264
So will say, document.getElementById('goalBtn').

00:04:18.264 --> 00:04:21.279
And then when this is clicked,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.500
we want to invoke the addGoal function.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.369
So now what we should be able to do is if we head back over to our app and hit refresh,

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:36.480
we can come in here and add a brand new Todo item,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.185
let's say, walk the dog.

00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:39.595
And when we hit "Add Todo",

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:45.270
you'll notice in our console what happened was we got this console.log right here.

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:46.589
And if you forgot,

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:50.229
the reason that we're getting that is because of this line right here.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.990
We said whatever the store changes,

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.470
go ahead and invoke this function which is just going to log the new state.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.200
So now, our new state looks like this.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.060
We have the Todo item here,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.720
and we can also come in here and add a new Goal.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.410
We'll say Learn Redux,

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.360
and now we have one Todo as well as one Goal.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.580
But both of those new items are being generated from our UI

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:18.089
now rather than just invoking dispatch inside of our console.
