00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.349
Now that we can add new Todo items to our list as well as toggle them,

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:08.713
and we can also add new goals to our goals list.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:15.230
The next functionality we need to add is being able to remove any one of these items.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.320
So back in our code here,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.399
right above our AddTodoToDOM function,

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:26.064
we're going to create a little helper function here called createRemoveButton.

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:30.760
And what it's going to do is it's going to take in an onClick callback.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.325
It's then going to create

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:39.160
a brand new button by using create element passing in the string button.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:45.544
We also want to say that this buttons in our HTML,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.020
it's just going to be a capitalist X,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.140
and then we want to say whenever this button is clicked on,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.770
so we will call addEventListener parsing in the string click.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.980
Whenever the button is clicked on,

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.109
we want to invoke the onclick function that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.620
was first parsed in one we called createRemoveButton.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.105
And then from there we want to just say returnRemoveButton.

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:13.740
So now inside of addTodoToDOM right here,

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.649
let's go ahead and create a new button.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.530
So we will say removeButton equals.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.590
We want to invoke createRemoveButton.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.588
And now we want to pass it to

00:01:24.587 --> 00:01:27.674
the function which is going to be called when this button is clicked.

00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:29.099
And if you remember,

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:33.685
in order for us to remove an item from the state of our store,

00:01:33.686 --> 00:01:40.965
what we want to call is this action creator right here.

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:45.960
So RemoveTodoAction parsing in the ID of the Todo item.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.500
So we will say is store.dispatch,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.484
and we want to invoke RemoveTodoAction parsing in the ID of the Todo item,

00:01:55.484 --> 00:02:00.212
which we can get from calling todo.id.

00:02:00.212 --> 00:02:04.824
And now, all we need to do is we can come in here and say after you

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:10.284
append the text to the node go ahead and also append this remove button.

00:02:10.284 --> 00:02:12.939
So now if we look at the UI here,

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.224
whenever we add a new Todo item,

00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:18.444
we have a button here,

00:02:18.444 --> 00:02:19.629
and when we click on it,

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.164
that item gets removed from the state

00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:25.884
of our store which means it also gets removed from the UI.

00:02:25.884 --> 00:02:30.549
So let's go ahead and now do the exact same thing inside of addGoalToDOM.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.100
So we can also remove goal items from the state of our store.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.049
So, just as we did before let's create

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.180
a another remove button variable here, by invoking createRemoveButton.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.210
And when this button is clicked on,

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.310
what we want to dispatch is our removeGoalAction parsing it the ID of this goal,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.844
which we can get from goal.id.

00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:57.444
And then now we also want to append that onto our node,

00:02:57.444 --> 00:03:01.584
so we can call appendChild parsing in a remove button.

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:04.150
So just to make sure that this works,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.300
we can say Learn Redux.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.894
Let's also give it one more. Say run a marathon.

00:03:09.894 --> 00:03:13.330
And then now we can come in here and remove

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.365
one which removes it from the state of our store,

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:19.615
which means it also removes it from the UI.

00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:20.980
So, now last thing,

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.104
just a small thing,

00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:26.454
I'm going to come, and delete all of these dispatches now.

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:28.574
Because we don't need to keep them around.

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:31.240
Because what we've done is we've taken

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.825
all those dispatches and hooked them up to our actual UI.

00:03:34.824 --> 00:03:39.519
So now, in order to update the state of our store,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.580
we can do that by doing it through our UI.
