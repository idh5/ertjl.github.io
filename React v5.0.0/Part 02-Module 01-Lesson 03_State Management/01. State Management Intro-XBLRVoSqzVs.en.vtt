00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.855
Now it's time to introduce three new concepts of React.

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.544

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:10.769
functional components which are alternative and probably,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.515
more intuitive approach to creating React components,

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:18.120
and controlled components which allow you to hook up the forms in your application,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.839
to your component state. Let's get started.
