00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Up until this point,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.389
we've used JavaScript's class syntax with a render method to build out our components.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:11.009
Eventually, we'll be adding more methods to these classes, but for now,

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.324
it's good to know that if all your component has is a render method,

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:18.149
you can actually just use a regular old function to create your component.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:21.000
Notice however, that we're no longer

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.420
accessing the component's props by using the this keyword.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.060
Instead, our functional component is being

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.489
passed it's props as the first argument to the function.
