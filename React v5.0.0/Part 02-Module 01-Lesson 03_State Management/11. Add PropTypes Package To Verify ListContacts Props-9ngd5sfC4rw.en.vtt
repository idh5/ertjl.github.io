00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
When we create our ListContacts element here,

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:04.934
what we are parsing it are two different prompts.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:09.164
Contacts which is an array and onDeleteContact which say function.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:12.179
But what if instead of parsing contacts and array,

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.224
what if someone on our team or even us later down the road,

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:18.149
accidentally parsed an object?

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:22.199
Then what would happen is you're going to see over here is we would get an error

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.089
because props.contacts is no longer an array it would be an object,

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.850
which would mean it doesn't have a.map property.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.710
So what we're going to do in this video,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.910
is we are going to implement a library called Prop Types,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.089
which will allow us to specify the specific

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.170
prompts that a component needs when the components or when the element is created.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.750
So what we'll do, let's go over here and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.899
change this back to our normal contexts and then head

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.390
over to our terminal and what we want to add to

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.049
our application is the package prop-types.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.089
Once that's done, go ahead and restart

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.900
your application and now head over to our ListContacts component.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.000
So as I mentioned earlier,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.432
ListContacts is going to take in two different props,

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.030
contacts array and onDeleteContact,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.359
which is a function.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:12.179
So first what we want to do is let's import

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.848
the PropTypes package that we just barely installed,

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:20.400
and now what PropTypes will allow us to do is they will allow us to come down

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.025
here and add a property to our ListContacts component, we'll say PropTypes.

00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:30.000
It's going to be set to an object and this object is going to represent all of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.180
the different props that can be parsed to our ListContacts component.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.009
So first, we are going to have contacts.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.670
Contacts as I mentioned a few times now is going to be an array and what's even

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.070
nice about PropTypes is you can specify if

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.079
a specific prop is going to be required or not.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.905
So we can come in here and say,

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:51.829
isRequired and then the other prop that we're going to

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.920
parse through this component is going to be onDeleteContact,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.234
which is going to be a function which is abbreviated to

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:03.064
func and that is also going to be required as well.

00:02:03.064 --> 00:02:09.650
So now what would happen is if instead of parsing in our contacts array,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.569
what if we parsed it an object here.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.400
And then now inside of our console,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.814
we still get the original errors but what we also get is this lineup here,

00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:21.680
failed prop type, Invalid prop contacts of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.379
type objects supply to ListContacts expected array.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.573
So what it's saying is, "Hey,

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:32.285
ListContacts needed the contacts prop to be an array but what you gave it was an object."

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:35.060
And let's say we forgot when we use ListContacts to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.260
parse in our onDeleteContact function,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.349
you'll notice what'll happen here is even though our app will still render because

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.799
the onDeleteContact function isn't going to be invoked until one of these X's is clicked,

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.310
we'll get an error in the console saying, "Hey,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.550
it looks like our ListContacts component needed

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.580
onDeleteContact because it was required, but it's undefined.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.565
You didn't parse it in when you created this element."

00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:01.530
And probably my favorite thing about

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.610
Prop Types is related to third party components that you use.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.230
So right now this ListContacts component is just our component that we created ourselves,

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.409
so it's pretty obvious to know what props that we're going to need,

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.460
but what if we used another component which is coming from say MPM?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.950
Or what if this ListContacts component was

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.964
a third party library that we install ourselves?

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:25.800
Now, sometimes it might be hard to know which

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.545
specific prompts you should parse the component.

00:03:28.544 --> 00:03:32.224
But if the author of that library added Prop Types,

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:36.099
all you need to do is look at the Prop Types definition in order to

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.949
know what specific props need to be parsed to the component that you're using
