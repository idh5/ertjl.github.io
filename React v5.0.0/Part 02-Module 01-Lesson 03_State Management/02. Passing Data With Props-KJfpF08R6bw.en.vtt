00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
Here we have a basic fetch user function the whole goal of this function is to fetch

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.860
a specific user the problem

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.460
here is that we need to tell the function which user to fetch.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.680
We can do that by adding a parameter to

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.660
our function definition and by passing in a username when the function is invoked.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.500
What I really like about React is that the same intuition you have about

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.335
functions can also be applied to React components.

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:32.230
Here we have a basic React component whose whole purpose is to display a user to the UI.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.849
Now we're running into the same problem we faced earlier with the fetch user function.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.579
We need a way to pass the user component a username so it knows which user to display.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.730
To do that we can add a custom attribute to our component and give it a value.

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.409
Now we can access that value from inside of

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.384
our component definition by using this dot props dot username.

00:00:54.384 --> 00:00:57.820
In fact, any attributes that are added to a component will

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.679
be accessible on the props object from inside of that component
