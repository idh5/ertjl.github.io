00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
So now, let's refactor our list contacts component from a component

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.890
extending the component property on the react object to a stateless functional component.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.140
So, first what we'll do is let's create a function here.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.629
We will call it the same name as our old component, ListContacts.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:20.570
And just as with the other component,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.839
we are going to return some UI.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.899
Let's go and copy all of this which again is just coming from the render method.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.994
Now, we can paste that into our return statement here,

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.664
and we will fix the indention real quick.

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:38.100
Then now instead of accessing everything

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.179
from this keyword as you see over here inside the error message,

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.490
we want to grab everything coming from

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.170
the props object that is being passed to our ListContacts component.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.350
So, as I mentioned, instead of the stop props,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.475
we can access our contacts by doing props dot contacts.

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:59.850
In the past, I've mentioned that you can use the same intuitions for

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.719
creating React components as you do normal JavaScript functions.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.469
Well, now that statement is pretty literal because you can have

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:12.075
actual JavaScript functions return you some JSX.

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:15.359
And now that we are using a stateless functional component,

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:18.614
we no longer need to import component up here,

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:21.399
so we can delete this section as well.
