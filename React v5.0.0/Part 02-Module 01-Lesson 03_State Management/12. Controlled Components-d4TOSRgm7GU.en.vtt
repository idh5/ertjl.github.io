00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
Typically when you're using forms in a web app,

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:05.378
the form state lives inside of the DOM.

00:00:05.378 --> 00:00:06.629
But as we've talked about,

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.309
the whole point of React is to more effectively manage state inside of your application.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.265
So, form state typically lives inside of the DOM,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.574
but React is all about safe management.

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:19.280
How do we handle forms in React?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.234
We can solve this problem with what React calls controlled components.

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:26.579
Controlled components are components which render a form,

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.459
but the source of truth for the form state lives

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.195
inside of the component state rather than inside of the DOM.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:35.700
The reason they're called controlled components,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.000
is because React is controlling the state of the form.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.234
Here, we have a component which is rendering a form with a single input element.

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:47.519
The first thing to notice is that we've added a value

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.105
attribute to our input of this.state.email.

00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:54.719
What this means is that the text in the input field is going to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.379
be whatever the email property of our component state is.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.179
Therefore, the only way to update the state in the input field,

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.129
is to update the email property of the component state.

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:07.219
As you can tell,

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.650
this is a true controlled component because

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.175
React is in control of the email property of our state.

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:16.143
If we want the input field to change,

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:21.243
we can create a handleChange method that uses setState to update the email address.

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:23.719
Whenever the input field is changed,

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.099
we can call this method by passing it to the onchange attribute.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.534
Although controlled components require a little bit more typing,

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:33.363
they do have some benefits.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:36.605
First, they support instant input validation.

00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:41.439
Second, they allow you to conditionally disable or enable for months.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.219
Third, they enforce input formats.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.905
Now, notice that all of these benefits have to do with

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:49.829
updating the UI based on some user input.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.515
This is the heart of not only controlled components,

00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:54.480
but also React in general.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.790
If the state of our application changes,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.000
then our UI updates based off of that new state.
