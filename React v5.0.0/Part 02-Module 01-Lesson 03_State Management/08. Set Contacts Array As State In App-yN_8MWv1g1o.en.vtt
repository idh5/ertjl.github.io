00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
Currently inside of our application,

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:07.560
we have our contacts array which we are parsing to our ListContacts component,

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.535
and ListContacts is responsible for looping over our contacts array,

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:15.120
and for each item in the array shows an individual contact.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.629
Right now you may have noticed that our contacts array is

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.410
living outside of our app component here,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.945
it's just living on the scope of this module.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:27.524
Now that isn't necessarily a bad thing,

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:30.390
but it's really outside of the world of React.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.520
Meeting if we were to change any of the items in any of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.920
the contacts or if we were to add or remove a contact from our contacts array,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.875
React would have no idea that that happened.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.759
One of Reacts strengths is state management and by having

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:50.719
our contacts array outside of our app component here,

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.625
we're not utilizing that strength at all.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:55.295
So what we want to do is we want to move

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:59.359
our contacts array into the local state of our app component,

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.780
so that way eventually when we start modifying our contacts array,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.939
React will be able to see that those changes are

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.469
happening and then update the UI based on those changes.

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.519
So what we will do, is we'll come in here and add

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:14.924
a state property to our local component,

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:18.435
and then let's go ahead and copy our array up here,

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:21.210
and then now on this state object this is going to

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.629
represent the entire state for our app component.

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:28.709
What we can do is we can add a contacts property and

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:33.629
this contacts property is now going to be our array of contacts.

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:38.084
So now, instead of passing our list contacts component,

00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:41.114
just contacts, what we want to do,

00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:44.604
is in order to get access to the local component state,

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:51.469
what you do is this.state.contacts so now you'll see that our UI looks the exact same,

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.810
but what we've done is we've moved our contacts array from just being out here,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.745
in the scope of the module,

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:02.469
to actually being a property on the local component state.
