00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
At this point in our application,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.099
we have our contacts array that we're parsing

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:08.429
down as a prop to our list contacts component,

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.625
and inside of list contacts we are grabbing that contacts array off of our prop's object,

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.190
we're using.map to map over it,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.120
and for each contact inside of our contacts array we are creating a list item,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.815
which just shows the contacts name.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.385
Right now, this is working fine,

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:28.730
but we want to instead of just rendering their name,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.855
we want to show something like this,

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:32.660
where we have their name,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.524
their Twitter handle as well as their Avatar.

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:43.774
So what we will do is first let's give each list item a className of contact list item,

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:46.804
and then now inside of the list item,

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:48.979
let's go ahead and delete this name for now.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.062
We'll add it back in here in a second.

00:00:52.063 --> 00:00:55.250
So let's have a div, we'll give this a className of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.369
contact Avatar and then what we also want to do

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.669
is we want to add an an inline style to this div.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.269
And the reason for that is we want to give this specific

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.363
div a background image that is the Avatar of the contact.

00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:13.207
So what we can do is we can give it a style,

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:17.899
so this the first curly braces here says hey we want to go into JavaScript,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.995
and then the second one,

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.600
says we want to give this an object.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:24.064
So what you need to parse the style prop is an object with

00:01:24.064 --> 00:01:28.054
each property on that object being a specific CSS property.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.025
So we can do is we'll set background image,

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:35.409
and then we will use backticks because we are going to use ES6 template strings.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.092
We will say URL and now we want to pass it the URL of the Avatar,

00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:45.780
which we can get by doing contact.avatarurl.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.820
So now we can close this div.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.349
Notice there's not going to be anything inside of it.

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.239
So we can just immediately close it.

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:53.789
And there we go we have all of the contacts now.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.440
The next thing we want to do is show the user's name as well as their handle.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.132
So we can say div with a className of contact details,

00:02:04.132 --> 00:02:05.939
and inside of here, as I just mentioned,

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.890
we are going to have two different paragraphs.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.969
The first one, will be contact.name and the second one is going to be contact.handle,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.219
and now if we save this what we should see is

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.574
the Avatar as well as name and their handle,

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:26.289
and now the last thing we want to add here is a button that looks like this.

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.875
So what we will do is we will have a button here and we'll give it

00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:33.580
a class name of contact-remove,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.030
and then for now we will just say button and we're not going to have this up here,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.120
but it'll be nice to have the UI in there, so there we go.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.590
Now instead of just rendering the contacts name,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.185
what we're rendering is their Avatar, the name,

00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:51.689
a handle and eventually an option to delete the specific contact.
