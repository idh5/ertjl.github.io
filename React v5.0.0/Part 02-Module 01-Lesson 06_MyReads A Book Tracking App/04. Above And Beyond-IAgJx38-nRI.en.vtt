00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.144
You'll have the opportunity to go above and beyond with this project.

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:06.298
We're giving you the styles and images so you

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.000
can focus on using React to build the project.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.288
But if you think about it,

00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:14.080
there are thousands of other students that are building the same project.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.887
You can make yours stand out by giving it a different look.

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:20.410
Remember that you learn the most when you try out something new.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.143
So why don't you try adding a new feature to the app?

00:00:23.143 --> 00:00:25.093
You could add a feature on rating your books,

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:29.629
or maybe the ability to bulk move books from one category to another.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.274
Now, these aren't required,

00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:33.268
but they'll definitely push you to learn React.
