00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Getting started on a project is often the hardest part.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.480
The easiest way to get started is to develop a plan.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.545
First, outline the steps you'll need to take to accomplish the project.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:14.520
It's often helpful to draw out what you want your application to look like.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.760
Then, think about the general architecture you want your app to have.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.510
For example, where do I put the state?

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.570
Which components will need access to the state?

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.440
If you spend some time planning your app upfront,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.165
I guarantee you that you'll save yourself a lot of debugging time later on.

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:33.840
Then, develop the app piece by piece.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.794
Get each piece working in isolation,

00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:37.715
and then connect the pieces together.

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.055
Test your app at every step along the way.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.365
Finally, before submitting your project,

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:44.180
be sure to compare your app against

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.395
the project rubric to make sure it meets all of the specifications.

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:49.215
Also, try to break it,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.560
try to squish those bugs,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.950
and then test all the required functionality again to make sure your app still works,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.200
and then it still meets all of the specifications.
