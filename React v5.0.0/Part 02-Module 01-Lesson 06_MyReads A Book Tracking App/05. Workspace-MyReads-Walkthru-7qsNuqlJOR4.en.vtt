00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
In the left hand side, here we have

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.795
the Filepicker where all of our files will be located.

00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:07.370
We can add new files by clicking this.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.130
We create new folders by clicking this button right here.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.365
Rename the folder and then create it right there.

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:17.840
Then we have our files here so we can open our file,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.095
and then up here along the top,

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:20.690
we can close it here.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.940
If we need to upload new files or directories,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.715
we can come down here and we could just drag and drop them onto here

00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:29.125
or just click on this and it will give us the pop-up window.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:31.880
Now to open up a new terminal, we can come down here.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.275
And if this is your first terminal,

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:36.020
you can just click on NEW TERMINAL and then after that,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.590
any subsequent windows we need to open,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.285
that we can just do with the little plus sign here.

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:42.925
Just keep clicking that and you'll open up a lot of new terminal windows.

00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:45.710
And then we can just keep closing them all along.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.630
So this is a terminal so you can install

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.535
any dependencies or install any packages with it.

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:54.815
One thing to note about this though is that this starts out in home/workspace,

00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:58.280
which is the same location as over here, home/workspace.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.150
So if we come over here and we list these files,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.340
these files here are the ones you're seeing over here.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.440
So when you add new files or upload new files,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.310
that goes into home workspace which is what your terminal starts out in.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.655
Once you started developing on your project and you're ready to see it in the browser,

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:17.960
you come down over here and click OPEN PREVIEW TAB. Let's do that now.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.060
Now, this is the URL for this specific project.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.045
Yours will definitely be different.

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:26.190
And notice that this project is not running any server,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.535
so nothing is actually running,

00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:28.920
so we're not actually seeing anything.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.125
If you get this, make sure you're actually running

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:34.500
a server or create React app that actually something is running.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.553
Let's go check out how to do that.

00:01:38.553 --> 00:01:41.530
Now that we've stalled everything,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.066
I can start the server.

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.015
Now the project is running but again,

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:50.605
don't open up local host.

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:54.340
We need to click on OPEN PREVIEW TAB.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.740
And here is our project.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.785
Once you've finished your project,

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.725
you come over here and click SUBMIT PROJECT.

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:02.535
This will send it off to be reviewed.

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:05.165
And then the last thing to point out is this menu button.

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:07.410
If something's going kind of crazy with your workspace,

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.169
just click on REFRESH WORKSPACE and that will

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.425
build you out a new workspace but will keep all of your data.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:16.900
If you want to start over from scratch and erase all of your work and all of your files,
51
00:02:16,900 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
just click on RESET DATA down here and that will erase everything and start from scratch.
