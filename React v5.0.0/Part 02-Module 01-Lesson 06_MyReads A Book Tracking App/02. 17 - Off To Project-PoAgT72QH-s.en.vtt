00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.095
It's time for you to put your newfound skills to the test,

00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:04.862
and build the My Reads app.

00:00:04.862 --> 00:00:07.660
You'll use React to build the application.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.309
If you remember from the beginning

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.500
the My Reads app let's you keep track of all of your books.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.480
This app will require you to manage state,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.149
build components, and leverage React router.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:19.039
The important part of constructing the app,

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.940
is building all of the React side of it.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.780
We'll be providing you with some basic styling and icons,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.829
since we want it to look halfway decent.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.448
We're not grading any of the visuals or anything like that.

00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:30.039
But enough listening to me.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.000
Time to get started with the project
