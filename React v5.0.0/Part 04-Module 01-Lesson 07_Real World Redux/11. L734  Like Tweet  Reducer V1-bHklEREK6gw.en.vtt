00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.115
So, inside of our tweets reducer here,

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:10.100
so "reducers/tweets.js" Let's import the toggle tweet action type and then,

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.875
now we want to add a new case here to our reducer.

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:15.449
So, if the case is toggle tweet,

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:22.100
how do we want to change the shape of the tweet slice of our state?

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.550
So, if you remember,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.539
let's go ahead and look at the final version here,

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.454
each tweet has these specific properties on it.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:37.019
The way that we're keeping track of who liked what is with this likes array right here.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.975
So, if the user is liking a tweet for the first time,

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:44.030
we want to take their id and put it in this likes array.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.015
If they are unlocking a tweet,

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:50.335
then we want to remove their username from this likes array.

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:52.965
So, the way that we can do that, is first,

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:56.300
we want to spread all of the previous tweets on the state.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.919
Because remember, we don't want to mutate this state directly.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.825
So, what we'll say is return a brand new object,

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:04.269
spread all of the previous tweets on that object,

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.414
but what we want to do is the tweet with the

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:15.215
id of whatever we're passing into action id that needs to be a new object,

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:18.920
and then we want to take all of the properties of that object,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.875
and spread them across onto this new object.

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:25.379
But, what we want to do is list likes array,

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.409
we want to either remove

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.359
the username or add the username based on if they have already liked it.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.209
So, what we can do is we can say,

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.599
if action.has liked equals true,

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:39.769
meaning they have already liked it,

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:41.905
then we want to come in here and use filter,

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:46.570
so say, state at action.id.Iikes.filter.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:55.479
Now, we want to say where the uid does not equal action.authedUser.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.260
So, this will filter out

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.640
the specific authenticated user if they have already like the tweet.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.349
If they haven't, what we want to do is the exact same thing,

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.400
instead of using.filter, we want to use ".concat" to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.069
add the username of the authenticated user to the likes array.
