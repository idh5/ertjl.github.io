00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.384
So now the last thing we need to do is now that we have our action creator, as well as,

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:10.219
our reducer here listening for that specific action type inside of our components folder,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.485
in our tweet.js here,

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:16.699
instead of just saying Handle Like Tweet we actually want to go and handle that tweet.

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.744
So, we should already be connected here,

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:21.314
so we are, so we're already past dispatch.

00:00:21.314 --> 00:00:25.399
So we will say, let's go ahead and grab dispatch

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.399
from this.props and then we also want to grab two more pieces of information,

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.170
the tweet itself, as well as,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.910
whoever the authedUser is.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.209
Then now when we dispatch,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.355
what we want to invoke is our handleToggleTweet function we created earlier.

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:46.379
So, we will go ahead and import that first, so, our handleToggleTweet.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.935
It's going to come from

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:54.350
action/tweets and then now what we want to dispatch is the invocation of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.980
handleToggleTweet and if you'll remember what we need to pass

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:04.390
it is an object here that has an ID property the authedUser,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.215
as well as, if they have liked it or not.

00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:11.430
So, we can pass along the ID which is going to come from tweet.id,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640
we can pass along if they have liked it,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.724
which will come from tweet.hasLiked

00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:19.179
and then we can pass along the authedUser because that's what we're

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.570
passing in to our tweet component as a prop because that's what we have right here.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.750
So, now if all of this is working correctly,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.810
what we should be able to do,

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.590
so let's refresh our app and open up our console.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.825
Whenever we click on this like button,

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:40.340
the TOGGLE_TWEET action is dispatched and you'll notice that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.640
the UI changed because we're alternating which

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.640
heart we should show the filled out heart or the empty heart

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.060
based on if the specific tweet has been liked or not.
