00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
Now that we have all of the data that we need in order to render our timeline,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.910
the next thing we need to do is actually build out

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.685
the UI inside of our components to do that.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:10.600
So, back inside of our terminal,

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.414
what we need to do is we are going to be using a few different icons here for this heart,

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.780
as well as this reply icon.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.660
So, what we will do is we want to install a new package from MPM called react-icons.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.535
Once that's finished, go ahead and restart your application,

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:30.704
and then head back over here.

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:32.449
We now need to import them.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.960
So I'm just going to paste these. So, we're getting an ArrowBackOutline.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.730
We're also getting a HeartOutline,

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:39.750
as well as a HeartFullOutline.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.784
So, technically, we have three different icons here: one for the reply,

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:46.119
one for the heart that is filled in,

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:49.239
and the other for the heart that is not filled in.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.325
So, now that we have those,

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:55.245
let's go ahead and start building out the UI of our tweet component here.

00:00:55.244 --> 00:01:00.155
So, first let's destructure all of the different properties that we will need.

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:03.204
We'll grab the name of the tweet's author,

00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:04.694
as well as their avatar,

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:07.149
the timestamp of the tweet, the text,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.815
if the author has liked it,

00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:10.920
how many likes and replies it has,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.629
as well as its ID,

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:15.759
and if it has a parent Tweet that it is replying to.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.780
All of those are going to come from tweet,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.355
which we have right here coming from props.

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:24.310
Then, now the first thing we want to render is an image.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.064
We want to pass it our avatar.

00:01:26.064 --> 00:01:30.569
We'll give it an alt tag of avatar of,

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:36.779
and then we will say name, and then last we want to give this a className of avatar.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.360
Now what we should see is we now have everybody's avatar.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:54.004
So, the next thing we want to render is this information right here.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:57.920
So what we will do is let's make another div here.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.939
We'll give this a className of tweet-info, and then inside of here,

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.274
the first thing we want to render is the actual name,

00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:08.895
we'll wrap that in a span,

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:14.330
then we want to render a div with the formatted date.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.700
So what we need to do is import that helper function,

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.964
which is going to be located inside of our helper's file.

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:25.409
So, now when we render this div,

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.254
we can say formatDate and we can pass it the timestamp.

00:02:31.254 --> 00:02:37.555
Then, now what we want to do is if the user is replying to another tweet,

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:39.900
we want to render this text right here,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.985
and If not, then we don't want to render anything.

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:46.790
So, what we can do is we can say if parent is a thing,

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.530
and it will be if, remember down here,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.289
tweets at tweet.replyingTo is a thing,

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.129
which means if tweet.replyingTo is a thing,

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.085
so if the individual tweet has a replyingTo property on it,

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:07.025
then what we will do is render this button here,

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:14.030
we'll give it a className of replying-to and then the text inside of here is going

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.659
to be replying to at the parent tweet.the author.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.449
Then what we want to add here is let's just say

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.824
when this function is clicked on, we'll get an event,

00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:30.799
and then we want to call a toParent method that we are going to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.800
build passing it the event as well as passing it the ID of the parent.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.590
So, now up here, let's just make a little place holder.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.610
So, what we want this tweet to do is first,

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.394
it's going to call e.preventDefault

00:03:47.395 --> 00:03:50.265
and then eventually what we will add is functionality.

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:55.189
So we'll say todo here, we want to redirect to the parent Tweet because again,

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.180
in our final version of our app,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.150
when you click on this text right here,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.900
what we go to is the tweet for the main parent Tweet that we were applying to.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.860
Then the last thing we want to render here

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.968
under our button but still inside of our tweet-info div is just the text.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.680
So, now if we look at our app,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.384
if we don't have any typos,

00:04:25.384 --> 00:04:27.029
we are getting there,

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:28.750
closer to the UI that we want.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.654
Now the last thing we want to render is our Reply and Like buttons down here.

00:04:33.654 --> 00:04:36.625
So we can do that by rendering another div.

00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:41.680
We'll give this a className of three-icons.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.555
Then, inside of here,

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:48.639
the first thing we want to render is our ArrowBackOutline.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.449
We'll give this a className of tweet-icon.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:59.824
Then we want to go ahead and show how many replies this tweet has.

00:04:59.824 --> 00:05:06.024
So we will say if replies does not equal zero,

00:05:06.024 --> 00:05:09.514
then what we want to do is go ahead and show this.

00:05:09.514 --> 00:05:11.680
So, if the tweet has zero replies,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.459
then we won't show how many has.

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:15.229
So, for example, right here,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.420
you'll notice it has no reply. So we don't show anything.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.004
But this one, we will show the number two because that's how many replies it has.

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:23.040
Then, now that we are showing the replies,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.780
the next thing we want to do is show the option to hearts or to like this specific tweet,

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.824
a function here called handleLike.

00:05:34.824 --> 00:05:37.849
So, let's do that right now.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.920
We'll build out the functionality for it later.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.310
So, what handleLike is going to do, right now,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.389
is it will just take in an event and call preventDefault on that for now.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.219
Then what we will do later on is make it,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.920
so when you like the tweet,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.580
it saves that information in the state of our redirect store,

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:59.050
as well as our database.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.610
So, now, inside this button,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.410
what we want to say is if hasLiked equals true,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:12.005
then the component we want to render is going to be our full heart outline.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:14.605
We will pass to it a color,

00:06:14.605 --> 00:06:16.110
which is the red color.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.530
So it's going to be e0245e.

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:22.949
So, very specific there.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.979
Then we'll give this a className of tweet-icon.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.775
Then if the tweet hasn't been liked yet,

00:06:29.774 --> 00:06:32.284
then the component we want to render is

00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:39.695
our HeartOutline components and we'll also give this a className of tweet-icon.

00:06:39.694 --> 00:06:43.579
So we can't forget to add this right here, the closing quote.

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:44.844
So that looks pretty good.

00:06:44.845 --> 00:06:49.040
Then the last thing we need to do is the same thing we did for our replies.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.335
So, we will have a span element here.

00:06:51.334 --> 00:06:54.694
If we'll say the likes do not equal zero,

00:06:54.694 --> 00:06:58.319
then we want to go ahead and show how many likes they have.

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.540
So, with that now,

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.525
what we should have is the full UI,

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:07.069
as well as the placeholders for our helper methods

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:11.709
that we're going to be building out in a video soon.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.829
So it looks like our CSS is a little bit messed up here.

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:17.634
So let's go ahead and fix that.

00:07:17.634 --> 00:07:23.649
What we should have is this info down here,

00:07:23.649 --> 00:07:28.304
the information about the name and the text of the actual tweet.

00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:36.204
It should be in its own diva and then all of this information,

00:07:36.204 --> 00:07:40.534
the tweet-icons container, should also be inside of

00:07:40.535 --> 00:07:45.439
this tweet-info and then we need to close the tweet-info div by doing that.

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:50.509
Now the only other change we need to make to our tweet component is,

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:54.550
right here, we have an ID variable that we're grabbing from tweet that we aren't using.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.845
So we can get rid of that. Then, now what our UI should look like is this,

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:01.245
where we have our avatar,

00:08:01.245 --> 00:08:03.524
all of the information about the tweet,

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:08.649
as well as buttons to reply and too like the individual tweets.
