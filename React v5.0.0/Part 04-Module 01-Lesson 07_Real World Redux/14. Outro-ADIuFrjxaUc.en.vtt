00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Our project is complete.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.075
We just finished building a Twitter clone that uses Redux to manage its state,

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:07.995
and React to control the UI.

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:11.179
How do you feel about this more complex Redux application?

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.140
Did it help solidify everything you started learning in the previous sections?

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.975
Why don't you share your finished project with your classmates,

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:19.825
so they can see all of your hard work?

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.945
When you post a link to your project,

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:24.899
include a short description of how all the pieces fit together,

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.240
and any custom modifications you made.
