00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.469
And then now that we are receiving our users as well as our tweets,

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:08.070
if you come and look at the final version of our app,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.400
the way that we are keeping track of the authenticated user,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.000
if you look at our state, is we just have this property right here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.899
We're not going to implement actual authentication but as a way to mark it again,

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:24.049
what we're going to do is we're going to stick the authed user on,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.460
the state of our Redux store so that way whenever we

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.830
like a tweet or whenever we make a new tweet,

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.284
we will know who the authenticated user is.

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:36.770
This authed user can be anyone of these three options.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.100
If you look at our data, it can be Sarah Edo,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.260
me or Dan Abramov.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:42.894
You can pick whoever you want.

00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:46.550
But now, what we're going to do is we will come up here and create

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.140
just a constants of the authed ID and then now,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.524
inside of here, what we want to do is dispatch,

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:56.109
setting the authed ID as a property on our Redux store.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.399
Again, we're not going to set up the reducer in this video but

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.030
it will be nice to have the action all finished.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.219
What we will do is let's create a set authed user action type up here,

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:13.939
and then we want to export our set authed user action creator.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.219
This is going to take in the ID of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.920
the authenticated user and then we will say set authed user,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.915
pass along the ID and then now inside of shared dot JS,

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:35.450
what we want to do is import that action creator from actions slash authed user.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.155
Then, down here, when we receive our users and we receive our tweets,

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:45.099
what we also want to dispatch is set authed user passing in authed ID,

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:49.024
which we have just hard coded again to avoid worrying about authentication.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:54.070
Now that we have all of our action creator setup and we are dispatching them,

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.799
the next thing we need to do is actually set up the reducers to

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.619
modify our state based on these actions.
