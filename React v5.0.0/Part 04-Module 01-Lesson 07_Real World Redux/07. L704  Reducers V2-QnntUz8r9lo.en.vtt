00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
So now that we are dispatching a few actions here,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.580
we need to actually set up our reducers to be able to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.245
modify the state based on those actions.

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:12.509
So what we will do is let's create a new folder here and we will call

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.649
it reducers and inside of here we are going to have a few different files.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.529
We will have users.js which will be our users reducer,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.600
tweets.js which will be our tweets reducer,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.645
and then we also need a reducer to handle

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:30.109
our authedUser so we will have an authedUser.js then lastly,

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.810
what we want to have is an index.js file inside of

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.725
here which will exports our invocation to combine reducers.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.640
So first let's do our users.js file.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.530
We want to import the receive users constant which is going

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.299
to come from action/users and now as

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.979
the default export what we want to do is export this user's

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.824
reducer which will set

00:00:56.825 --> 00:01:01.080
the default state to an empty object and then it will take in an action.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.890
So we want to say switch on action.type as we've done before,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.980
when the case is receive user,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.814
this is going to receive users with an

00:01:11.814 --> 00:01:16.719
S. So when the case is receive users thn what we want to do is

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.799
the new state of our users slice of

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.950
our state is going to have everything

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.519
that was on that which will really just be an empty object,

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:32.334
as well as all of the users which we are grabbing from the action,

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:37.804
and then the default state is just going to return the state.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:39.310
So that looks good for

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.040
our users reducer and I'm going

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.100
to copy this because our tweets reducer is going to be similar.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.659
Instead of receive users what we're going to have is received tweets as

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.310
the action type which is going to come from action/tweets,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.105
so now we have our tweets reducer here.

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:01.010
When we receive tweets,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.490
we want to merge all of those tweets onto

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:08.028
this object and then as always we return

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:12.549
the state that was passed in when none of these cases match.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.180
Now inside of our authedUser reducer,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.780
we're going to do something similar,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.294
where you want to import the set authedUser action type,

00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:28.929
coming from action/authedUser and then as default export,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.155
we want to export authedUser.

00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:36.949
State will initially be null so we will use default parameters here to set it

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:41.179
equal to null when this function is invoked with the state of undefined,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.319
which it will be the first time that it's invoked,

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.159
and then we want to switch on action.type when the case is set authedUser,

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.935
what we want to do is return

00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:57.245
action.id and the default case as always again we just return the state.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:01.129
So now what we have is our three different reducers which are handling all of

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.344
the action types that we saw being dispatched inside of our handle initial data function.

00:03:07.344 --> 00:03:10.909
So what we want to do inside of our index.js

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.245
file is we want to import combined producers,

00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:16.939
as well as all of

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.560
the different reducers that we've just barely made so we will grab authedUser,

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.039
as well as users, and finally tweets.

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:35.539
And now what we want to do as the default export is export

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.479
an invocation to combine reducers passing it all of

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.729
our different reducers which are authedUsers,

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.729
users, as well as tweets-
