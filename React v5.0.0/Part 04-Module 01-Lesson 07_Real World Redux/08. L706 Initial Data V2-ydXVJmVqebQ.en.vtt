00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
Now, that we have set up our action creator for handling the initial data,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.880
we have created all of our different actions that need to be dispatched,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.330
and we've also set up our reducers,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.365
which will handle those dispatches.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.940
The next thing we need to do is actually invoke

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.059
handleInitialData when our application loads.

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:23.004
So, what we'll do is inside of our components folder,

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:24.919
inside of app.JS here,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.780
what we want to do is import a few different things.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.855
We will grab connect,

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:32.750
which is going to come from react-redux,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.670
and then we want to grab these function.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.969
I just barely talked about handleInitialData coming from action slash shared.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.299
Then, now what we want to do is,

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.709
when this component mounts,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.535
we want to dispatch the invocation of our handleInitialData action creator.

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:55.909
But in order to get access to dispatch,

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.939
what we need to do is we need to connect our app component, so we can just connect it.

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:03.049
Notice, we don't need anything from the state.

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.944
So, we just leave the first invocation blank.

00:01:06.944 --> 00:01:09.509
Then now, inside of componentDidMount,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.945
what we can do is call this.props.dispatch,

00:01:12.944 --> 00:01:17.219
and we can invoke our handleInitialData action creator.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.385
So, now if we don't have a typo anywhere,

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:22.340
what we should see if we refresh

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.620
our application is the UI is still the same because we haven't changed that,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.300
but now, you'll notice inside of our console because we set up our logger middleware,

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.340
we are now seeing all of the actions that are dispatched.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.259
What the new state of our store looks like is we have our auth.user,

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.590
we have all of the different tweets,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.630
and we also have all of the different users.

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:49.144
So, now that we actually have the initial data we need to render our application,

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:53.489
what we'll do in the next videos is we will start building out the main view in our app,

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:57.269
which is going to be this dashboard view.
