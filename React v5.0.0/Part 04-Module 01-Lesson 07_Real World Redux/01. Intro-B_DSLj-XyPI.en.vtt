00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Up until this point,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.849
we've covered all of the features of Redux by building out a simple To-do's App.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.640
This project was great for learning purposes,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.530
but it's somewhat rudimentary and isn't

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.864
representative of the complexities of a real-world project.

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:18.210
So, using all of the topics we learned so far, Redux-React,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.550
React-Redux bindings, and middleware,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.920
we'll build a more complex real-world application.
