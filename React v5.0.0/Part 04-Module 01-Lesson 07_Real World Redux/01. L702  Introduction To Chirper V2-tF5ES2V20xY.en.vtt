00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.714
So first, let's take a look at the project that we are going to be building.

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:05.820
This is a minimal Twitter clone,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.575
and if you want to play around with it yourself,

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:09.530
you can come to this URL right here.

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.004
So basically, what we have here is a timeline,

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:15.150
and these are all the tweets on your timeline.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.589
You can make a new tweet by coming to this view.

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:21.934
We'll make a new tweet here and submit that,

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:23.859
and then that will show up on our timeline.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.730
You can like any of the tweets and you can also click on a tweet in order to reply to it,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.969
so you'll notice here that this tweet has two different replies.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.619
If we want to make another one we just simply compose a new tweet on this tweet page.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.094
Now this tweet has another reply,

00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:44.109
and we can like their replies,

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.615
we can even make replies to the replies.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:51.440
So technically, these replies are infinitely deep because we

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:55.149
can just keep replying to different replies,

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.199
and that's essentially it.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.910
What's interesting about this application is it

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.019
really benefits from using Redux because in a lot of the different views that we have,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.780
we're sharing the same state.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.855
So for example, when we make a new tweet,

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:12.085
that tweet is eventually going to show up on our main timeline,

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:17.194
but also what's happening is when we like a tweet from this view,

00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:19.809
when we go into the actual tweet view

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.600
for this specific tweet we still need to see that like.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:31.064
Whenever we make a new response then what needs to happen is this counter is incremented,

00:01:31.064 --> 00:01:35.149
and also this counter is incremented on the main page as well.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.050
So in basically every single one of the views that we have in this application,

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.909
we're needing to reference at least a part of our Redux store,

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.539
which means Redux is a pretty good use case for this specific project.
