00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Because we are using this syntax right here where we are

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.500
returning a function from an action creator,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.884
we need to make sure that we hook up the redux-thunk middleware in order to support that.

00:00:10.884 --> 00:00:15.254
And while we are here we are also going to add in our logger middleware.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.929
So let's create a middleware folder and then inside of here we

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.469
will have two different files first index.js which

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:25.710
will export an invocation of apply middleware and then

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.285
also our logger.js file so first let's do a logger.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.119
And again what we want logger to do as we do

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.969
this weird middleware syntax here which takes in the store.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.660
Next as well as an action is we want

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.344
logger to show us anytime that a new action is dispatched.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:50.979
As well as what the new state is going to be after it's dispatched.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.189
We will group these things together inside of the console and then we

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.820
can log what the action is by just console logging action.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.170
We can then get a return value here from

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.530
invoking next which is going to be dispatched passing at the action.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.180
So that will update the state which will allow us to then say

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.284
the new state is we can get by calling store.getState

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:23.300
and then finally we just want to return value here and we can't forget we want this to

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.394
be the default export and now inside of index.js in our middleware folder.

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:35.854
What we can do is we can import logger coming from logger.

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:41.840
And now we want to make sure that we install the redux-thunk package

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.450
so inside of your terminal you can go ahead and install

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.730
that by saying yarn add redux-thunk.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.140
And then once that's finished go ahead and restart your app head back over to

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.165
your index.js file inside of your middleware folder.

00:01:58.165 --> 00:02:03.500
We want to import the thunk middleware that we just barely

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.349
installed and then finally we need to import apply middleware.

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.900
From the redux package and an invocation of apply middleware is what's going to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.599
be our default export here so we can say thunk as well as logger.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.799
And then now inside of our index.js file,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.210
we need to make sure that our store is aware of our middleware so what we can

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.730
do is imports middleware from dot-slash middleware and

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.669
again what this is going to do is it's going to say okay go ahead

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:41.059
and import the default export coming from the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.509
index.js file in the middleware folder which is

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.584
going to be our applied middleware invocation right here.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:52.520
Now what we can do is as the second argument to create

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.570
store we can pass our middleware and even though we won't see

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.439
anything yet because we're not dispatching any actions that's what we will do in

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.079
the next video is when our uploads we'll go ahead and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.410
fetch the initial data that our application needs.
