00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
Congratulations on finishing this course on Redux.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:05.894
Redux can be a challenging topic to grasp.

00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:07.819
If you still feel a little bit shaky,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.500
the best way to solidify your understanding is by

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.054
using these techniques to build real-world projects.

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:17.579
The good news is we actually have a project ready for you to tackle.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.744
I'll hand things over to Richard to give you the specifics on that.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:22.260
But before I let you go,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.140
I want to congratulate you again on finishing this course.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.109
I hope this course has helped you think differently about how you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.379
go about managing state inside of your applications.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
