00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
So the first thing we want to do is invoke our getInitialData

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.259
function so that way we are getting back the initial data that our application needs.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.679
So, what we'll do first is we will go ahead and build out a new actions folder,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.495
and inside of here we're going to have a few different files,

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:18.870
we will have an authedUser.js,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.475
we're also going to have a shared.js,

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:24.620
then we will have a tweets.js,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.705
so it'll be all the actions related to our tweets,

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:32.759
and then we will also have an action's file for our users.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.574
So, what we'll do first is inside of shared we want to first

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:43.670
import that getInitialData function coming from util/api,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.510
and now what we want to do is we want to export a function,

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:51.619
we'll call it handle handleInitialData,

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.419
and this function is going to use

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.240
the Redux return pattern because we want

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.440
to make an asynchronous request inside of this function.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:03.359
So, what we will do is we will call getInitialData,

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.829
that will then return us a promise

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.489
which will pass to us an object that has a user's property, as well as,

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:15.924
a tweets property, and then now what we want to do is we want to take our users,

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:20.084
and take our tweets, and add them to the state of our Redux store.

00:01:20.084 --> 00:01:24.039
So to do that, we will need to dispatch a few different actions.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.540
So, what we'll do is let's head over to tweets.js first,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.060
and we're going to export a new variable here that we're going to call RECEIVE_ TWEETS.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.180
So this is going to be the action type,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.450
when we receive and dispatch all of our tweets to update our store.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.870
Then the function that we want to export will be called receiveTweets,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.650
this will return an object or the action with a type of RECEIVE_ TWEETS,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.625
and then we will pass any tweets here,

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.069
as the first argument,

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.089
when this function is invoked.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.650
So now, we have a receiveTweets action creator,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.629
let's go ahead and do something similar for our users.

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:10.955
So, the action type that's going to occur when we receive our users,

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:13.885
we will say is receiveUsers,

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:22.283
and then we want to export the receiveUsers action creator with a type of RECEIVE_USERS,

00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:24.754
and then we will pass along the users as well.

00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:28.500
So now what we can do inside of shared.js,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.724
we can import both of those different action creators.

00:02:32.724 --> 00:02:34.319
So we'll grab receiveUsers,

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.750
which is coming from action/users,

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:46.335
and then we also have receiveTweets coming from action/tweets.

00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:49.280
So, now we can do inside of our function that we're

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.724
passing to.then is we can call dispatch,

00:02:52.724 --> 00:02:55.835
receiveUsers passing it to users,

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:57.580
and we can also call dispatch,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.520
receiveTweets passing at the tweets,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.110
and even though we haven't set up our reducers yet to actually handle these dispatches,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.220
we'll go ahead and do that in a few of the next videos.
