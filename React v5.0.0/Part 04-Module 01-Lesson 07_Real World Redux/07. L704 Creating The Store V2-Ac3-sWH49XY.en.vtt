00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.769
So, then, when we import our default export from our reducers folder,

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:07.014
that will be our main route reducer.

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:09.480
And so, let's go ahead and do that now.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.060
So, inside of index.js is where we want to actually go ahead and

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.385
create our store as well as wrap

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:20.670
our app inside of the provider components we can pass it our store.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.190
So, what we'll do is head over to your terminal,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.490
and we need to install a few different things.

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.079
So, what we will do is, let's say,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:37.099
yarn add we want react-redux as well as redux.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.574
Then once those are done,

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:45.640
go ahead and start your application again and head back over to your main index.js file.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.990
and what we want to do is we want to be able to create a store,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.675
so this package is going to come from redux.

00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:57.424
We want to be able to wrap our app in this provider component,

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.015
which we can grab from react-redux,

00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:01.884
and then we want our reducer,

00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:08.575
which is going to come from our reducers folder.

00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:11.040
So, then in order to create our store,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.020
all we need to do is call create store passing it our reducer.

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:24.795
Now, we can wrap our main app component inside of this provider component,

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:28.540
and we need to make sure that we pass provider,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.545
our stores, that it can stick it on context.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:36.920
So, what we'll do in the next video is we need to add

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.810
some middleware to our application so that this syntax right here,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.025
where we return a function rather than an object from our action creators,

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:48.020
will be supported, and we

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:50.189
can check out our console to make sure we don't have any errors.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.670
It looks like we have one. Just a typo that you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.329
probably noticed right here inside of authedUsers.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.280
So, now we should be good. So, what we'll do in

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.170
the next video is we will add in that middleware.
