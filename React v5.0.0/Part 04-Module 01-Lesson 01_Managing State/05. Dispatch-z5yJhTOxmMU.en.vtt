00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
Let's review what we have so far.

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:04.429
There are three parts to our app,

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.240
the actions, the reducers function, and createStore.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.095
The actions represent the different events that will change the state of our store.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:16.535
The reducer is a function which takes in the current state and an action which occurred,

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:18.120
and returns the new state.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.920
And createStore is responsible for creating the actual store.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.865
If you remember back to our implementation of createStore,

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:27.320
so far we have three of the four parts.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.820
We have the actual state.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.100
To get the state, we have a get state function.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.390
And to listen for changes,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.429
we have a subscribe function.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.155
The last part we need to figure out,

00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:37.700
is how to update the state.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.065
To do that, we'll create a new function called dispatch.

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:42.619
Let's go ahead and do that now.
