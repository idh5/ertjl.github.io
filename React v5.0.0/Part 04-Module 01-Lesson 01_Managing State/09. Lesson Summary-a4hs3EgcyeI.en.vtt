Well, that's it for less than one.

00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:03.839
At this point, you've already covered

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.500
the most important parts of our state management library,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.550
the store, actions and reducers.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.640
In the next lesson,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.440
we'll take our app and add some UI to it so you can see

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.730
how our library commands the state of a Javascript application.
