00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So what I have here is a brand new index.js file,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.519
and the first thing we want to do is we want to build

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.320
a function that's going to create us a brand new store.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.745
So what we'll do is let's create a function here first,

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:13.929
we'll call it createStore,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.644
and again remember the store is going to be responsible for four things;

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:21.102
it's going to manage the state,

00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:23.865
then we need to provide an API or a way to get the state,

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:27.854
a way to list all the changes on the state as well as a way to update the state.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.929
So, in order to do number one here,

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.244
what if we came in here and create a variable,

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:36.959
let's just call 'state,' so this state variable

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.524
is going to hold the state of our entire application.

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:40.979
So this one is done right here.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:46.214
Now, what we need to do is we need to provide a way to get access to the state.

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:49.095
So what if we came in here and did something like this,

00:00:49.094 --> 00:00:53.795
well lets create a new function,

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:58.140
we'll use an arrow function and all getState is going to be responsible for is

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.015
returning us the state of our application which it can do just by returning state,

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:08.064
and then now what we want to do is whenever createStore is invoked,

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:10.064
we want to return an object,

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:13.649
and as I mentioned earlier one of the properties on that object that we

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.430
want to give the user is the ability to get the state.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.210
So all we need to do is add

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:25.349
the getState property here so whenever they invoke createStore,

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:30.305
they'll get an object back and in order to access the internal state of our store,

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:34.359
they can just invoke the getState method.
