00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
Before we add our next piece of functionality to create store,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.630
let's review the functionality has so far.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.745
First, it contains the state,

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:10.964
next, it has a getState function,

00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:13.560
which just returns us the state, and finally,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.075
it has a subscribe function,

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:18.509
which will let each of the listeners know whenever the state changes.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.735
If you remember back to when we first talked about our store,

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:23.099
there were four parts.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.455
The state, getting the state,

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:27.375
listening to changes on the state,

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:28.844
and updating the state.

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:31.454
As of right now, we have three of the four.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:34.994
So let's add in that fourth piece updating the state.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.739
Now remember, the whole goal here is to increase

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.484
the predictability of the state in our application.

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:43.964
We can't just allow anything or anyone to update the state.

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:47.550
If we did, that would drastically decrease predictability.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.649
In fact, the only way in which we can

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.335
increase predictability in terms of updating the state,

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:56.085
is by establishing a strict set of rules for how updates can be made.

00:00:56.085 --> 00:00:58.649
Let's look at an NFL team for example.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.740
In order for a team to maximize their chances of winning,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.950
they always have to be on the same page.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.685
They need to operate as one cohesive unit.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:11.275
Every miscommunication can and will lead to negative consequences.

00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:14.710
So in a sense, NFL teams have the same goals that we do.

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:16.524
Increasing predictability.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.835
But how do they go about accomplishing this?

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:20.529
Well, they create a Playbook,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.614
and each player must know it by heart.

00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:25.704
This way, when the team runs a play from the playbook,

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:29.004
players will know exactly what each member of the team will be doing.

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:30.924
Maximizing predictability.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:34.899
Can we take the same idea and apply it to our applications?

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.420
Well, we can, and it's so fundamental

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.445
that we'll call it rule number one to increasing predictability.

00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:43.334
Just like NFL teams have a collection of place,

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:45.809
we too can have a collection of events that can occur

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.890
in our app which will change the state of our store.
