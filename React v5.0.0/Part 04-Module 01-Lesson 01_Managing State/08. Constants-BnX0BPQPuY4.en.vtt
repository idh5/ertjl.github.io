00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
So at this point, all of the state portion of our application is finished.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.850
We can add new to-dos.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:06.869
We can remove to-dos,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.879
toggle to-dos, add goals, remove goals.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.785
So, all of that is looking great.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.095
But what I want to do now is I just want to make

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:17.280
a few smaller more opinionated changes to how we're doing things,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.054
that I think will improve the quality of our code.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:25.410
One thing you may have noticed that we're doing is whenever we have an action-type here,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.899
say this add to-do action-type for example,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.808
we're using the string add to-do.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:32.579
We're doing this all over,

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.364
whenever we dispatch it and also inside of our reducer function.

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:40.385
Now, strings are fine and they work great in this case.

00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:45.784
But I think, it would be a little bit better instead of having a string here,

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:47.539
what if we made that a variable.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.229
Because right now strings are prone to typos.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.474
If we came down here and then we said,

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:56.929
add too, for example.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.924
It's a very common error that you might make.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.204
Now all the sudden, this isn't going to work

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:03.949
because of that one small change right there.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.400
And this is going to be a hard bug to find because you're probably not going to get

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.790
any errors for this because it's just going to dispatch with the type of add too.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.785
But nowhere inside of our reducers do we have a case for add too.

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:21.744
So, what's going to happen is even though this will be dispatched,

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:27.520
because we aren't listening for the add too action-type up here inside of our reducers,

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.429
nothing is actually going to happen.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.445
So, what we want to do is let's come up here at the top of our app code.

00:01:36.444 --> 00:01:40.569
And we're going to convert all of these different strings to variables.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.669
Instead of referencing strings everywhere,

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.935
we can just reference the single variable.

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:49.195
So, what we'll do is let's make an add todo variable,

00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:52.599
which is just going to equal the string add todo.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:58.479
And then now, anywhere inside of our application where we are using add todo,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.710
instead of using add todo the string,

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.929
we can use add todo the variable.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.870
And we can do this for every single action type inside of our application.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.585
So, we're going to have remove todo here as well.

00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:17.605
So, let's go and grab anywhere that we are calling remove todo,

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.819
which I think is just in those two places.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.484
We also want to have toggle todo.

00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:26.885
At this point, you probably get the idea.

00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:32.254
Let's go and adjust all toggle todo now to be the new variable.

00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:37.924
And now we want to also do them for our goals reducer.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:41.944
So, I believe we have an add goal action-type, we do.

00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:50.794
Then now, add goal needs to be converted to the variable, add goal.

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:53.089
And the very last one,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.759
we're going to have remove goal,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.189
which we then need to convert to select all of the remove goals.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.740
All right, now what we've done is we've

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.679
removed all of the different strings that we have.

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:09.939
We made those variables.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.699
So now, anywhere inside of our application,

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.879
if we want to compare,

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.389
if we want to add new action-type called toggle todo,

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.698
all we have to do is reference the constant,

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.170
reference the variable up here,

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.109
rather than typing out the string every single time.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.590
And I get. It's just a small change but eventually all of

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.420
these small changes that we make are going to add

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.079
up to making our application a little bit better.
