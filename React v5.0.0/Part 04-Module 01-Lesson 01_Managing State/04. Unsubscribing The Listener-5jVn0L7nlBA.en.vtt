00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.934
But now that we've given a way for the user to subscribe to changes,

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:08.730
we also want them to have a way to unsubscribe for changes.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.224
For example, if they did both of these subscribes,

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:14.535
and then they wanted to unsubscribe this function,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.125
we need to provide them a way to do that.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:20.129
So what we'll do, is when they invoke subscribe,

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:23.410
let's return them a brand new function,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.903
and when they invoke that function,

00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:28.510
what we can do internally,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.790
is we can call listeners.filter,

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.475
and we want to filter out

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:41.695
the original listener function that was parsed in when subscribe was invoked.

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:43.969
So now, in order to unsubscribe,

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.149
all the user has to do is create a new variable here,

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.689
when they invoke store.subscribe,

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.144
and then that's going to be a function that they can invoke in order to

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:01.162
unsubscribe this specific listener.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:04.810
So, we'll get rid of all our example code here.
