00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Welcome to Udacity's Redux course.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:05.129
The goal of this course is to help you learn how to more

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.875
effectively manage state in your applications.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.449
As a byproduct of that,

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.564
you'll have to learn Redux along the way.

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:15.344
Now, you may find this course a little slow. That's on purpose.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.429
The reason we're going to take it slow is because

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.204
historically Redux is pretty difficult to learn.

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:22.829
The problem isn't necessarily Redux itself,

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.724
but everything else that you typically pair with Redux.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.365
What happens is traditionally when you learn Redux,

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:30.640
you also learn alongside React,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.890
React-Router, React-Redux bindings, and a few other helper libraries.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.020
This causes all sorts of issues because

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.540
your brain has a hard time separating what's what.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.094
To fix this, we're going to take a slow gradual approach.

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:46.185
We'll start off by looking at just Redux, nothing else.

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.225
Once you've mastered Redux itself,

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:51.505
we'll add in some basic UI with just HTML and JavaScript.

00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:54.905
Then, when you're feeling comfortable with hooking up Redux to a simple UI,

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:57.050
we'll swap out that UI for React,

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:59.119
and you'll learn how the two work together.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:03.268
We'll then look at some common pain points when combining React and Redux,

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:07.460
and we'll learn how the React-Redux bindings help solve these pain points.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:13.129
Finally, we'll use Create React App to see how a real-world React and Redux app is built.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:14.780
Now, we're covering quite a lot,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.004
but remember we're going to take it slow and go step-by-step.

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:20.339
With that said, let's get started.
