00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
Now that we've decided we're going to put all of

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:05.370
our state into a single location called the state tree,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.230
the next thing we need to figure out,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.450
is how we'll actually interact with it.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.394
If we're actually going to build a real application with our state tree,

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:16.259
there are three ways in which we'll need to interface with it.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.530
First, we'll need a way of getting the state.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.820
Second, we'll need a way to listen for when the state changes.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.285
And third, we'll need a way to update the state.

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:29.579
Let's go ahead and wrap all of these things

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.460
together into a single concept called the store.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.515
So, when we talk about the store,

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:39.049
we're talking about the state tree as well as three ways in which we'll interact with it,

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:43.669
getting the state, listening for updates to the state and updating the state.
