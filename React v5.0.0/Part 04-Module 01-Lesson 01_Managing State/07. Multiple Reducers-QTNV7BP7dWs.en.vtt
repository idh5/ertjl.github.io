00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
At this point, we now have to reducers,

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:05.445
our Todos Reducer and our Goals Reducer.

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:10.195
Each is responsible for handling their specific slice of the state tree.

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:12.165
This introduces a new problem though.

00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:14.137
When we called createStore,

00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:16.815
we passed to it our single Todos reducer.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.966
Whenever dispatch was called,

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.294
we'd call this reducer,

00:00:20.294 --> 00:00:23.260
passing at the current state and the action which was dispatched,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.810
and we get back the new state.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:28.350
Well, now we not only have our Todos reducer,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.529
we also have our Goals reducer and each are expected to

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.450
receive their specific slice of the state tree whenever an action is dispatched.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.240
What we need to do, is instead of passing createStore out single Todos reducer,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.294
we want to create almost like a root reducer function,

00:00:44.293 --> 00:00:46.140
which will be responsible for calling

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.189
the correct reducer whenever specific actions are dispatched.

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.449
That was a lot of words to say that we want our app to now work

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.585
with both our to Todos reducer as well as our Goals reducer.

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:58.369
Let's see what that will look like.
