00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
Pure functions are defined by three characteristics.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:08.265
First, they always return the same result if the same arguments are passed in.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:11.610
This means that even if you call the function a million times,

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.879
the function will return the same value every single time.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.929
Second, they depend only on the arguments passed into them.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.054
In other words, they'd never access values outside of their own scope.

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:27.589
The return value of a pure function is determined only by its input values.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.553
And finally, pure functions should never produce any side effects.

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:35.574
This means that the function has absolutely no interaction with the outside world,

00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:38.890
such as making network requests or mutating external state.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.585
If a function passes all three of these requirements, then it's a pure function.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.685
If it fails even one of these,

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:47.410
then it's an impure function.

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.500
Remember that we're trying to manage state predictably.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.719
Impure functions aren't bad,

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.164
but they are inherently not predictable.

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:58.548
On the other hand, pure functions are predictable,

00:00:58.548 --> 00:01:03.020
and this is why we need our functions to be pure to increase state predictability.
