00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.214
Now that we have finished the four parts of our store, we have internal state,

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:05.445
a way to get the state,

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:06.893
listen to changes on the state,

00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:09.234
and now we have a way to update the state.

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:11.864
And we also have a reducer function here,

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.339
which specifies how the state will change

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.425
based on the action which occurred in the application.

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:20.205
Let's go ahead and take a look at what this actually looks like

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:24.019
when we use our createStore function.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.530
So, in order to create the store,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.439
what we want to do is we will say const store equals createStore.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.444
Remember what we need to pass createStore,

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:34.109
is our reducer function.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.104
So we can pass it todos.

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:40.259
Now, store is going to have three methods on it.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:43.020
Get state, subscribe, as well as dispatch.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.015
So first, let's call store that's subscribe,

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:48.791
and whenever our state changes.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.679
What we want to do is we want to console.log the new state is,

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:02.090
now how do we get the state of our store while we can call store.get state.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.969
So now that we've set up that listener,

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:07.400
the next thing we want to do is actually dispatch

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.955
an action so we can see how the store will change.

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:15.498
So what we'll do is we can call store.dispatch,

00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:17.410
now we want to pass in action.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.644
And if you remember, we had an action with a type of add to-do,

00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:25.759
and then this action also had

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.469
a to-do property which had an Id which we will just give zero.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.417
And that also is going to have a name property,

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:38.379
we will say learn redux and then finally it's going to have complete,

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:40.104
which we will just set to false.

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:43.180
So now what should happen when we execute this code,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.720
this function will run because we updated

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.234
the state and then we will see that there is now

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:57.489
a new object inside of our state because that's what we specified right here.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.097
So, I'm going to copy all of this and head over to my console,

00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:04.799
and then I'm just going to execute it here so I've just pasted that in.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.229
First, we will call store.subscribe, so everything looks good.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.014
You'll notice that we received back from store.subscribe

00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:15.389
function that we could have called to unsubscribe this listener.

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.129
And then now, when I paste in store.dispatch,

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.127
we now get this brand new arrays,

00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:23.724
the new state is this array.

00:02:23.724 --> 00:02:26.574
So we have one item in our array complete a set of false,

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:29.810
id is zero, and the name is learn redux.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.000
And what's cool about this now is,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.039
we can call dispatch as many times as we want.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.704
We still want to dispatch the add todo action type.

00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:41.705
We'll give this an Id of one.

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:44.545
Let's change the name to read a book.

00:02:44.544 --> 00:02:49.250
And let's change complete to true,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.475
and now you'll notice that we have two items in our state,

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:54.534
learn redux as well as read a book.

00:02:54.534 --> 00:02:58.712
So whenever we want to update the state of our store,

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:01.268
all we need to do now is called dispatch,

00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:04.870
passing it the action which occurred.
