00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.193
Think about any application you've ever made.

00:00:03.193 --> 00:00:07.634
Most likely that app was composed of two things, UI and state.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:10.244
Now, think of any bug you've ever had.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:13.500
Odds are that bug was caused by state mismanagement.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Your application was expecting the state to be one thing,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.390
but it was actually something else.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.210
When your computer freezes and you have to restart it,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.825
that's because some state inside of your computer got to a weird place.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.480
By restarting it, you reset that state.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.699
When a website says you have a new notification,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.469
but you click on that and there's nothing new,

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:34.365
that's because the state of the app was mismanaged.

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:36.060
As I said previously,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.651
the goal of this course is to make state management,

00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:40.875
any app you build more predictable.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.740
One of the best ways to improve the quality of the apps you

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.810
build is to improve the predictability of the state in an application.
