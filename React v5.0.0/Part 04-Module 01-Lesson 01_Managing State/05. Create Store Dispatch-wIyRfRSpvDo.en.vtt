00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.205
Now that we have some internal states,

00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:05.445
we have a way to get that state with our GetState method,

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:08.759
we have a way to listen to changes on it with subscribe,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.009
and then we also have a function which takes

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.904
in the current state and an action that occurred,

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:16.204
and returns us the new state of our app,

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:18.464
the only other thing we need to figure out,

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:21.960
is how to actually update the state of our store.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.390
And the way in which we're going to do that,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.105
is with a new function here that we will call dispatch.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:32.685
So what dispatch is responsible for,

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:38.655
is it's responsible for updating the state inside of our actual store,

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:41.895
so in order to do that, what it needs to do,

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:45.420
is it needs to receive the action which is going to tell

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.679
dispatch the specific event that occurred inside of the application.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:56.850
And now, with access to the state and with access to the action that occurred,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.265
what dispatch can do in order to get the new state of the application,

00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:09.754
is it can call our todos function up here passing it the state and passing it an action.

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:13.069
So what we'll do is, the state internally

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:16.339
inside of our store is going to now be whatever gets

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.430
returned from calling todos passing at

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.783
the current state and passing it the action which occurred.

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:25.849
And then now because we just modified the state,

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.979
if you remember what we need to do as well,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.155
is we need to loop through all of our listeners,

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.614
which is just going to be an array of functions,

00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:34.729
and invoke each one of them,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.645
so that any listener to the user setup will be invoked.

00:01:38.644 --> 00:01:41.239
So what we will do, is we'll say

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:48.789
listeners.forEach and then for each listener inside of listeners,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.470
we will just go and we will invoke it.

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.409
So, now whenever the user wants to update the state internally inside of our store,

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.530
what they need to do is they need to invoke dispatch,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.370
passing it the specific action which occurred.
