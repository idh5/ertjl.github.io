A completely different aspect that HTTP2 tackles is security.

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.270
E-commerce has become the norm and so has handling

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.790
sensitive data like credit cards and contracts.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.685
It's fair to call it gross negligence if websites handle this kind of data without TLS.

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:17.745
That's why TLS is a required part of the specification for HTTP2.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.135
There is an unencrypted version of HTTP2,

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:23.275
but all major browsers have opted out of supporting it.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:25.800
We've talked about TLS before and you'll be glad to hear

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.015
that nothing's changed when using TLS with HTTP2.

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:32.020
But how does HTTP2 solve the other problems?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.805
How does it resolve head of line blocking?

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:36.010
And how does header compression work in HTTP2?

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.230
Let's find out.
