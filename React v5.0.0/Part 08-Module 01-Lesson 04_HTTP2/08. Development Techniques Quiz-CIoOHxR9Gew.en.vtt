00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Any step that combines files together and Sprite is a

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.625
combination of images has to be reconsidered with HTTP/2.

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:12.110
Most of the time it will be a bad idea since it makes caching totally inefficient.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.430
Minification is still a good idea since it

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.355
reduces the number of bytes that need to be transmitted.

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:22.465
So minifying javascript, CSS and Markup are correct.

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:26.565
Sharding is not a good idea as it makes the HTTP/2 header compressor

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:31.455
less efficient and causes new connections to be opened by the browser which is costly.

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:34.500
Using a CDN, just a single one,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.575
outweighs the drawbacks of sharding as it brings your assets

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:41.562
geographically closer to your users and reduces the round trip time,

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:43.015
so this is also correct.

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:46.380
As you can see there are a number of things we need to do differently,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.000
so make sure you understand the implications HTTP/2 brings to application development.
