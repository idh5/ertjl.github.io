00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.275
This is the result for the HTTP1 server,

00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:06.585
and over here is the result for the HTTP2 server.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:10.900
The HTTP1 server transferred 336 kilobytes

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.575
while the HTTP2 server transferred only 177 kilobytes.

00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:19.045
That's roughly a 47 percent reduction in transfer of bytes.

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:21.230
That's almost half the number of bytes.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.605
Not surprisingly, the HTTP2 server also loaded the site a lot faster.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:29.670
It loaded the site and all its assets in 911 milliseconds.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.210
The HTTP1 server took a total of 2.86 seconds.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.175
That's roughly a 68 percent increase in speed.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:41.060
So, the HTTP2 server is a lot faster and also transfers less information.
