00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
In this exercise, I want you to see the difference between loading

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.115
a site over HTTP/1 versus loading it over HTTP/2.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:10.895
You'll find the binary in the instructor notes below.

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:13.760
Download it and start it using the console.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.245
It will start both in HTTP/1 server as well as an HTTP/2 one.

00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:21.670
Use the links provided by the binary to launch each site.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.235
Both servers actually host the exact same website.

00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:28.135
Then use dev tools to figure out the reduction in total bytes transferred.

00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:30.160
Enter the percentage difference here.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.902
Then figure out how much the load time increased.

00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:34.585
Enter that percentage here.

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:37.180
Check in the instructor notes for some helpful tips on

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.590
working with the binary and loading the exercises.
