As far as we are concerned,

00:00:02.155 --> 00:00:05.805
HTTP/2 works the exact same way HTTP/1 does.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:09.350
What changes is the performance and the precautions you have to take.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.550
You should start building a web app with HTTP/2 in mind since

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.815
a number of browsers that don't support HTTP/2 is getting smaller and smaller.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.580
If you're running your own server or trying to

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.845
figure out where to host your web app yourself,

00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:23.665
make sure to enable HTTP/2 there, too.

00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:25.440
For more information on how to do that,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.430
there's a link in the notes with instructions for

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.875
the most common service providers and servers.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:31.840
In the next lesson, we'll take a look at

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.270
more security measures like cross origin resource sharing,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.670
same origin policy, and cross-site scripting.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.000
You might even get a chance to do some hacking yourself.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
