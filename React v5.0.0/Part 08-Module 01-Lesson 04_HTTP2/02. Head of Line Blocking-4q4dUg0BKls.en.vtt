00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
The average number of requests needed to properly display

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.800
a website rises constantly and has recently risen over 100.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.270
That means on average,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.860
a website requires over 100 requests to display correctly.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.800
Things are getting a little crazy.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.600
Remember that HTPP 1 does not work well with lots of requests.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.920
Fortunately HTTP 2 has come to the rescue.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.000
We'll look at some problems of HTTP 1 and how HTTP 2 is solving them.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.385
One of the reasons we have so many requests,

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.640
is because of Head of Line blocking.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.030
We talked about this earlier,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.110
but it's so important.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.250
Let's briefly go over it again.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.815
Head of Line blocking is when one request is blocking others from completing.

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:45.450
A browser will open at most six connections to the same server.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.395
That means at most six requests can be in-flight simultaneously.

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:50.726
At the very least,

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:55.105
you'll have to wait for the request to be sent and then the response to be sent back.

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:57.615
These two together are called the round trip.

00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:03.295
And the round trip time can take between 20 to 50 milliseconds on a good connection.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.380
Let's do some quick math.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.200
Let's say a site needs to send 100 requests to load completely.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.670
We can handle six requests in parallel,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.155
which means ideally each connection will need to make

00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:20.346
17 requests to download all 100 requests.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:25.050
With each request having a round trip time averaging roughly 35 milliseconds.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.230
This yields 525 milliseconds.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.480
About half a second of waiting, of doing nothing.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.430
And this assumes that actually transferring

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.535
the requested file doesn't take any time at all.

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.545
If the file being transferred is large,

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:43.060
then this number will become a lot bigger.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.510
This round-trip time is an average.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.501
If there's an unstable or slow Internet connection,

00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:50.065
things only get worse.

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:54.000
Head of Line blocking is a disaster to good loading performance of a website.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.240
With HTTP 2, we don't have to worry about Head of Line blocking.
