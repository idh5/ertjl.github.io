00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
HTTP has been around since the early 90s.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.645
Between just 2010 and 2015,

00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:09.075
the amount of data transferred for a single web page has tripled.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:14.145
The number of requests necessary to get all that data is on a steady rise as well.

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.105
HTTP is used for things and in

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:19.080
conditions that are very different from what it was designed for.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.140
Design choices that made complete sense back then are now

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.730
becoming a burden both in terms of development and performance.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.280
Some current best practices like concatenating all your JavaScript into

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.305
a single file solely exist to work around the shortcomings of HTTP1.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.270
This is where HTTP2 comes in.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.280
While also being backwards compatible,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.350
it solves the biggest issues HTTP1 has.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.680
We will learn how HTTP2 is different from

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.070
HTTP1 and how these differences help make your apps better.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
