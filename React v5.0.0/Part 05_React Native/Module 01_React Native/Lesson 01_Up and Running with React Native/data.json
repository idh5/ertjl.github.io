              "text": "## React Native under the Hood\n\nWhen React was first introduced, a big selling point was the [Virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html). The idea is pretty standard in most UI libraries now, but when it first came out, it was groundbreaking! We can look at what exactly the Virtual DOM is by breaking down the process of what happens when you call `setState()`. \n\nThe first thing React does when `setState()` is called is merge the object passed to `setState()` into the current state of the component. This will kick off a process called [reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html). The end goal of reconciliation is to update the UI based on this new state in the most efficient way possible. To do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this new tree, React will \"diff\" it against the previous element tree in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state. By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, it will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary. \n\nThis process of creating an object representation of the DOM is the whole idea behind the \"Virtual DOM\". Now, what if instead of targeting and rendering to the DOM, we need to target and render to another platform -- say iOS or Android. Theoretically, the DOM is just an implementation detail. Besides the name itself (which, in my opinion, was more of a marketing ploy than anything), there's nothing that couples the idea of the Virtual DOM to the actual DOM. This is the exact idea behind React Native. Instead of rendering to the web's DOM, React Native renders to native iOS or Android views. This allows us to build native iOS and Android applications just by using React Native.\n",

              "text": "## Create React Native App\n\nWhen we build our app throughout this course, we'll be building it for both Android and iOS. One of the puzzles at hand is that we'll need to support two separate development environments: iOS uses [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), and Android uses [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). This introduces a lot of complexity into this course; after all, both Xcode and Android Studio could probably each _be their own set of courses_!\n\nLuckily for us, there's a new tool we can use that will allow us to develop for both Android and iOS without ever opening up Android Studio or Xcode. It's called, not surprisingly, **Create React Native App**. It's similar to **Create React App** in that all you have to do is install the CLI via NPM. Then, via the CLI, you can easily scaffold a brand new React Native project. \n\nJust like Create React App, there are pros and cons to using Create React Native App (CRNA). First, the pros. \n\n### Create React Native App Pros\n\nThe obvious one is that Create React Native app minimizes the amount of time it takes to create a \"hello world\" application. The fact that you can run a command in your terminal and 15 seconds later have a project that run on both Android and iOS using JavaScript is pretty incredible. Next, and we'll look deeper into this one later on, Create React Native App allows you to easily develop _on your own device_. This way, any changes you make in your text editor will instantly show on the app running on your local phone. Next, and this is something I mentioned earlier, with Create React Native App you just need one build tool. You don't have to worry about Xcode or Android Studio. Lastly, there's no lock in. Just like Create React App, you can \"eject\" at anytime.\n\n### Create React Native Cons\n\nNow, there are some cons, and granted they're pretty minor, but they're good to be aware of. First, if you're building an app that's going to be added to an existing native iOS or Android application, Create React Native App won't work. Second, if you need to build your own bridge between React Native and some native API that Create React Native App doesn't expose (which is pretty rare), Create React Native App won't work.\n\nLet's jump right in!\n",

There's no need to compile any native code. And much like Create React App, using Expo with Create React Native App lets us get an application up and running with almost no configuration.\n\nWe'll be relying on Expo heavily in this course. First things first: you need to _install_ Expo.

If you're looking to integrate React Native into an existing app, or if you've ejected your app from Create React Native App, feel free to follow the [Building Projects with Native Code](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) tab from the React Native docs. The guide also sets up iOS and Android simulators, allowing you to view your mobile apps right on your machine! \n\nWe'll be utilizing both iOS and Android simulators in the interest of demoing projects in this course, but they are completely optional in getting started.\n\n### Installing Simulators\n\n#### 🔷 iPhone Simulator 🔷\n\niOS apps can only be developed on a Mac unless you have a virtual machine set up on your machine. To set up the iPhone simulator on your Mac, follow these instructions:\n\n1) Go to the App Store.\n\n2) Download Xcode.\n\n3) Follow the installation instructions.\n\n4) Open Xcode and install additional software if prompted to do so.\n\n\n**If you already have Xcode installed, please make sure that you update it. Then, open it to make sure no further updates are needed. Most problems with setting up your React Native development environment can be solved this way.**\n\n5) Open Xcode and go to \"Preferences.\" \n\n6) Go to the \"Locations\" panel and select the most recent version in the \"Command Line Tools\" drop-down list. \n\n7) That’s it!\n\n#### 🔷Android Simulator 🔷\n*The setup is kind of complicated, but we'll get through it together.*\n\n**Part 1**\n\n1) Install a recent version of the [Java SE Development Kit(JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).\n\n2) Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)\nChoose a \"Custom\" setup when prompted. Make sure the boxes next to all of the following are checked:\n\n* Android SDK\n\n* Android SDK Platform\n\n* Performance (Intel ® HAXM)\n\n* Android Virtual Device\n\n3) Click \"Next\".\n\n4) Launch Android Studio.\n\n5) Click on \"Configure\" and select \"SDK Manager\".\n\n6) Select the \"SDK Platforms\" tab.\n\n7) Put a checkmark next to \"Android API 28\",  \"Android 8.0\", \"Android 6.0 (Marshmallow),\" \"Android 7.0,\" and \"Android 7.1.1.\"\n\n8) Go to the \"SDK Tools\" tab.\n\n9) Put checkmarks next to :\n\n* Android SDK Build-Tools\n* Android SDK Platform-Tools\n* Android SDK Tools\n* Android Emulator\n* Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)\n* Under the Support Repository, put a checkmark at \"Android Support Repository\"\n\n10) Click \"OK\".\n\n11) Follow the on-screen directions to install the requested components. \n\n12) If you are on a Windows machine, please install the Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator through the Android SDK Manager, if prompted. \n\n13) If you are on a Windows or Linux machine, please make sure to enable Virtualization Technology in your BIOS settings.\n\n14) If you are on a Windows machine:\n\na) Open Android Studio. Go to \"File\" and then click \"Project Structure.\"  Make sure this box is checked: \"Use embedded JDK(recommended).\" Please copy the Android SDK location (e.g. `C:\\User\\userName\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk`); we'll be using it shortly.\n\nb) Open the System Control Panel. Click on \"Advanced system settings.\" Click on \"Environment Variables.\" Create a new variable `ANDROID_HOME` and set it to the Android SDK location you copied before.\n\nCreate a new variable `JAVA_HOME` and set it to the installation path for the Java Development Kit (e.g. `C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_171`).\n\n15) If you are on a macOS or Linux:\n\na) Open Android Studio. Click on \"Configure\" and select \"SDK Manager\" again. Go to Appearance & Behavior  -> System Settings -> Android SDK. \n\nb) Look at the path that’s filled in for the \"Android SDK Location\" section. It should be something like: `/Users/yourName/Library/Android/sdk`. If you are on macOS or Linux, add the Android SDK location to your PATH using `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bash_rc` (e.g. `echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/Library/Android/sdk/'>>~/.bash_profile`).\n\nc) On macOS, you will also need to add platform-tools to your `~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_rc` (e.g. `echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools' >>~/.bash_profile`, `source ~/.bash_profile`).\n\nd) Make sure that you can run `adb` from your terminal.\n\n**Part 2**\n\n*You have a choice of either using the Android Studio Emulator or Genymotion as your simulator. You don't have to install both.*\n\n**Directions for Setting up the Android Studio Emulator**\n\n1) Open Android Studio.\n\n2) Click \"Start a new Android Studio project\".  You don't need to change any of the settings; just click through to \"Finish\". Click \"Finish\".\n\n3) Once a new project is created, look at the messages inside the Gradle Console.\n",

[Expo CLI 2.0](https://blog.expo.io/expo-cli-2-0-released-a7a9c250e99c) powers the latest version of Create React Native App by default. Most of the information in the terminal remains the same, but to start the project, the directions advise to run `expo start` instead of `npm start`. If you download or clone the in-class project, you'll see exactly the same information in the terminal as is shown in the videos. ",
