Let's recap what you've accomplished:\n\n* You built React components that make use of props, state, event handlers, and data propagation.\n* You built a React application that uses lifecycle methods and React Router, handles asynchronous requests, and effectively manages state.\n* You built a React/Redux application that handles asynchronous requests and combines the state management features of Redux and the component model of React.\n* You built a React Native application that effectively manages state and uses React Navigation, AsyncStorage, and proper styling. \n\n",

Completing the optional React & Redux project that's located in the Extracurricular section.\n* Practicing technical interview questions on your phone.\n* Contributing to open source projects.\n* Learning more about front-end technologies via the included extracurricular courses.\n* Learning more about mobile app development by taking other Nanodegree programs.\n\n## Completing an Optional React & Redux Project\n#### Project: Readable \n*(This project is not required for graduation.)*\n\nGet additional practice with React and Redux by building a “Readable” application where users can post text content and comment on each other's posts. You’ll build this dynamic application from scratch while combining the state management features of Redux with the declarative component model from React. When complete, you’ll be able to submit your own posts, comment on existing posts, and edit and delete posts and comments. \n\nYou'll be able to submit this project for review and get valuable feedback to maximize your learning! Even though you're not required to attempt or pass this project in order to graduate, we encourage you to give it a try.\n\n## Contributing to Open Source Projects\n\nWith your new skills in front-end web development, you can extend your projects with additional functionality or even contribute to open-source projects you find on the web. The sky's the limit! \n\nHere are some open source projects that look interesting: [Mark Erikson's list](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links/blob/master/apps-and-examples.md) and [10 React Native Open Source Projects You Must Know](https://apiko.com/blog/10-react-native-open-source-projects-you-must-know). \n\n## Leaning More About Front-End Development via the Included Extracurricular Courses\n\nDon't forget to check out the extracurricular courses that are included in this program:\n\n* ES6\n* Client Server Communication\n* Asynchronous JavaScript \n* Git & GitHub\n\n## Learning More About Mobile App Development\n\nYou may want to look into these Nanodegree programs:\n\n**[Android Basics by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803)**\n\nYou'll learn to build apps through 6 hands-on projects and will gain strong foundational knowledge of Java.\n\n\n**[iOS Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003)**\n\nIn this program, you’ll not only learn how to build iOS apps, you’ll also learn best practices in mobile development and gain mastery of Swift, an open-sourced object-oriented programming language. Through 6 hands-on, reviewed projects, you’ll gain the skills you need to become an iOS Developer.",
