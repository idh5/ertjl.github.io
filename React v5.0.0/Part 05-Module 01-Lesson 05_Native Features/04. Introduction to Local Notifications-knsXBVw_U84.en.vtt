00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
In this section, we're going to add notification reminders toward your UdaciFitness app.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.870
If you're not familiar with what a notification is,

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.324
it's a little pop up you get on your phone whether or not the app is running.

00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:18.454
So, on our app every day at 8 o'clock if the user hasn't logged their stats for that day,

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:21.394
they should get a notification reminding them to.

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:24.919
Expo provides us with a notifications API which

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.325
has a scheduleLocalNotificationAsync method on it,

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:32.000
which is exactly what we'll need to have local notifications to our app.
