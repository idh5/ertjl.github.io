As far as features go,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.730
the app is pretty much all done.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.054
There is, however, one small change I want to make.

00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:09.099
If you push your app to the App Store,

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.669
there are some settings that you'll want to configure specifically for the

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.894
App Store,and that's what we can do inside of our app.json file.

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:21.539
So what we can do is things like set the orientation.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.805
Say, we wanted only portrait mode to be active,

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:26.095
meaning if you flip your phone,

00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:29.294
nothing's really going to change. We can do that here.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:36.130
We can also set the name of our application which we will call UdaciFitness.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.150
We can also put in a description here,

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.820
the best triathlon tracker ever.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.480
Slug, which is something for Expo,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.019
which basically is like your own custom URL.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.222
We'll say, udacifitness.

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:56.314
Version, let's go ahead and give it a version 1.0.

00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:58.059
So I think it's pretty good.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.650
We can give it an icon,

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.329
which I'm just going to use as a local icon that's hosted on my site.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.265
You can do the same.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.560
So this way, when the user downloads the app,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.290
the icon they're going to see is this guy right here.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.000
And then what we can do is we can also set up or edit our notification icon,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.069
which I'm just going to have

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.784
the same image except it's going to be just a little bit smaller.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.049
And when you do this,

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.599
you're not going to see a change on your emulators.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:32.054
You need to actually build the app in order to see this notification change.

00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:35.157
So if it doesn't work because you're not actually building the app.

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:38.375
don't worry. Once you push it to the App Store, it should work.

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:42.489
And then the only other things we need in order to prep for

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:47.655
the App Store are these things right here, bundleIdentifier.

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:52.635
What this is going to be is just an identifier for the App Store for your app.

00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:55.915
So we'll just say udacifitness.exp,

00:01:55.915 --> 00:02:00.925
and then Android also needs one as well.

00:02:00.924 --> 00:02:06.685
But in Android, it's called package and it's going to be the exact same name.

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:10.620
So that, after many videos, is basically it.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.150
We learned how to build a React Native app. We learned about routing.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.305
We learned about native e-stuff like notifications,

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:23.340
and we even learned about preparing our app for the App Store. Hope you enjoyed it.
