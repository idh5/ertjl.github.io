Up until this point,

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.384
we've learned all about React Native.

00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:08.865
But one thing we haven't done yet is taken advantage of any native API's.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:11.849
So in this lesson, we're going to do just that.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.744
We'll take a look at how animations work in React Native,

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:17.214
will then dive into geolocation,

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:23.350
notifications, the camera, and preparing your apps for the iOS and Android app stores.
