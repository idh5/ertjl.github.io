00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.944
Now, the last scenario which is the best scenario,

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:08.589
if the user grants us permission and status, will become granted.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:10.320
So what we want to do in this case,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.025
I'm just going to go and paste some styles down here again,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:15.804
so you don't have to see that.

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:18.535
Basically, what we have is a container,

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:22.579
some font stuff, direction which is going to be purple,

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.309
some more containers. You can check that out if you want to.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:30.779
So now, inside of this section down here what we're going to do

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.734
is the container is going to be styles.container, the main view.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:39.549
And then, now what we want to do,

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:41.625
let's have a view here.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.085
And again what we're building in this section,

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.429
is this UI right here.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:55.435
So in this section which is going to be our styles.directioncontainer section,

00:00:55.435 --> 00:01:02.295
what we want to show is some text that says, you're heading.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:06.765
And then, we want to give this a style of styles.header.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.144
And then, below that,

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:12.824
some more text which is the actual direction that we are heading.

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:16.165
In this case, we'll just hard code north.

00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:18.405
It's going to be styles.direction.

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:20.129
So this section looks great.

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:22.155
Below that what we want to do,

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:26.625
is now we want to have this metric section down here.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:30.989
So what we can do is have another view which

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:35.685
is going to have a style of styles.metriccontainer.

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:36.960
And then inside of here,

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.079
we are going to have a few different things,

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.519
a view with a style of styles.metric and then a text.

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:48.539
Again, this is going to be

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.375
kind of a boring video because we are just building out this UI,

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:52.859
so if you want to do this on your own,

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.304
by all means feel free to.

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:58.420
But this text is going to have a style of,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.739
is going to have two styles.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:05.954
Styles.header and then we will give it a color of whites.

00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:10.329
And then what it's going to say is altitude.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.195
And then below this,

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:13.530
it's going to be very similar,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.419
so we can just copy and paste this.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:20.629
Instead of header, it's going to be sub header and we will just have,

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.634
let's say, 200 feet will also hard code that.

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:27.435
And then now, let's go ahead and copy and paste

00:02:27.435 --> 00:02:31.585
this because this next one is going to be similar.

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:35.295
We have metric and then we have styles white.

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:36.579
Instead of saying altitude,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.640
this is going to say speed.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.234
And then instead of saying 200 feet,

00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:42.960
this can say, let's say,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.545
300 miles per hour. All right.

00:02:47.544 --> 00:02:52.184
This looks pretty good. Let's go ahead and look to see if this is working.

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:55.490
There we go. So even though the state is hard coded now,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.460
the UI looks pretty good.
