00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.410
Alright, the last thing we're going to add to our application is local notifications.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.070
So that way, if a user forgets to log their information on a specific day,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.710
at eight o'clock that day or really,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.295
whatever time you specify,

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:18.000
they'll get a local notification on their phones or just a pop up on their phone saying,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.445
"Hey don't forget to log your information."

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:24.449
So what we're going to do is, first,

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.271
let's go ahead and grab AsyncStorage,

00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:31.544
and then, we need to grab a few different properties off of expo.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:36.170
Notifications is the first and Permissions is the second.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.765
And then let's go ahead and create a NOTIFICATION_KEY just like we did earlier,

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:49.554
and we will just call this, UdaciFitness:notifications.

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:51.500
All right, so now we're going to make,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.299
let's go down here to the bottom,

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.024
we are going to make three different methods.

00:00:56.024 --> 00:01:01.079
The first, we're going to call it clearLocalNotifications.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.504
The second, we're going to call, createNotification.

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:12.509
And the third, we are going to call and export, setLocalNotification.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.115
So let's go ahead and do createNotification first.

00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:17.864
This is basically just going to return an object,

00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:20.359
which represents the notification.

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:25.560
So we will say, the title is going to be hand-wave because I like those,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.810
as you've seen, Log your stats.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.670
The body, actually, let's save the hand-wave for the body.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.144
The body is going to say hand-wave,

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:41.359
don't forget to log your stats for today.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.253
ios, sound, of course,

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:44.314
that's going to be true,

00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:45.780
we want to make a sound.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.924
And then Android, we have a few different options here.

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:51.719
We can say sounds.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.745
Of course, priority is going to be super high.

00:01:56.745 --> 00:01:59.755
Sticky will say false, we don't want to stay.

00:01:59.754 --> 00:02:02.625
Vibrate, absolutely. All right,

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.784
so this is going to represent our notification.

00:02:05.784 --> 00:02:07.280
And so now, what we're going to do in

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.259
setLocalNotification is we want to check if we've already set a local notification.

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.909
We don't want to set another one because that means the user would

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.789
then get two notifications or three and on and on.

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:22.109
So what we're going to do is if we're going to use AsyncStorage to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.330
check using getItem to see if our NOTIFICATION_KEY has been set,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.620
so we'll grab the data, and then from here,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.300
we will just call JSON.parse actually.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.770
And then we have,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.060
if this is a thing or not,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.835
So we have the data, we can say,

00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:45.000
if data equals null,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.030
meaning we haven't already set up a local notification,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.199
then what we want to do is just as we saw in a previous video,

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.959
we want to use Permissions.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.094
This should be Permissions,

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:59.354
and we will say, askAsync.

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:04.109
The permission we want to ask is Permissions.NOTIFICATIONS.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.860
When we get back,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.850
whatever they said, that's going to come in as the status.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.549
And then now, what we will do is we will say,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.945
if the status is granted,

00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:20.039
we are good to go.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.359
If the status is granted,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:30.750
then what we want to say is Notifications.cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.777
So if we've already established a notification,

00:03:33.777 --> 00:03:35.414
go ahead and cancel that.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:40.879
And then what we want to do is we're going to make this date right here.

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.694
So tomorrow, we're going to call setDate on it,

00:03:44.694 --> 00:03:46.979
and the reason for this is because we want to get

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:51.509
a time tomorrow at let's say eight o'clock.

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:56.639
So we'll say, tomorrow.setHours and tomorrow.setMinutes.

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.359
So exactly at eight o'clock,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.780
this tomorrow object is going to represent.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.735
And then we will say, Notifications.scheduleLocalNotificationsAsync.

00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:14.281
The very first thing we're going to pass it is createNotification,

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:15.390
the invocation of that,

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.260
so we get back this object,

00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:21.405
and then we're going to pass it some options.

00:04:21.404 --> 00:04:25.424
Time that we wanted to run is going to be tomorrow.

00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:29.500
Repeat, we want it to repeat on the daily.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.459
And then, down here, after that,

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:37.139
what we want to do is we want to make sure that we

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.894
establish inside of AsyncStorage that we have set up this local notification.

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:43.709
So we will say, setItem.

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:47.789
NOTIFICATION_KEY is going to be,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.955
we'll go ahead and stringify this just because true.

00:04:51.954 --> 00:04:56.995
So this looks good assuming we don't have any typos anywhere.

00:04:56.995 --> 00:05:00.879
Let's see. All right, so we are good.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.625
So again, what's happening here is when we call setLocalNotification,

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:06.274
which we will do in the next video,

00:05:06.274 --> 00:05:09.899
it's going to go, and make sure we haven't already set a local notification.

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:13.564
If we haven't and the permission is granted,

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:17.375
we'll clear all the local notifications just in case we don't set two.

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.920
We create a date object that's going to represent

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.960
tomorrow at eight o'clock and then calling scheduleLocalNotificationsAsync.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:28.629
We pass a createNotification when we want it to go

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.569
off mand then we set that in local storage.

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.879
Now, the last thing we need to do is build out our clearLocalNotification function.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.944
So this one is going to be pretty straightforward.

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:45.069
What we're going to do is we're going to call AsyncStorage.removeItem.

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.579
What we're going to remove is the NOTIFICATION_KEY.

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:50.764
And then when that's finished,

00:05:50.764 --> 00:05:53.185
what we want to do is call,

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:59.425
Notifications.cancelAllScheduleNotificationsAsync to cancel,

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:02.000
as it says, all notifications.
