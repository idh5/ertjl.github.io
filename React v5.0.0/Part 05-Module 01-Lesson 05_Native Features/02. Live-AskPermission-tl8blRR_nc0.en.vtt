00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
All right, this is the video we have been waiting for.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.290
We are going to learn how to ask the user for permission

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.675
to view their location and to track their location.

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:14.655
What we'll do is inside of askPermission down here,

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:16.109
let's go ahead and fill this out.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.804
What we want to do is we will say permissions.askAsync.

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:24.660
So instead of get async, it's askAsync.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.460
What we are asking for,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.765
just as we are on line 15, is saying permissions.location.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.980
Then, what's going to happen is we are going to get

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.909
a status back just like we did and component did mount.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:44.774
And then now what we can say is if the status is granted,

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:50.954
then what we want to do is let's go ahead and say return it's called setlocation.

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:53.064
If it's not granted,

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:55.829
then just as we did before,

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.414
we'll just set the status so that our state is aware of what's happening.

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:03.299
And then any error we get,

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.750
let's just go ahead and make sure that we log that so we are aware of it.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.030
Say console.warn, let's just say error asking location permission,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.775
and then we will log the error.

00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:20.850
All right. That looks good. I did notice one typo here.

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:23.184
This should be askAsync.

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:26.185
You probably saw that but I obviously did not.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.320
So now what's going to happen,

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:29.789
let's see this in action.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.890
We go to live.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.420
You notice, hey you need to enable location services for this app.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.375
When we click on enable,

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:40.000
notice we get this sweet little pop up here saying,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.935
expo would like to have access to your location.

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:46.695
Do you want to allow it or deny it?

00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:49.559
I'm going to go ahead and click allow,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.780
and then you'll notice we have some information here,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.659
but this is the information from

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.394
the static data not the data we're getting from the phone.

00:01:57.394 --> 00:02:02.039
So what I want to do real quick is update our render methods.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.070
You'll notice that we still have direction and coordinates down here.

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.719
So here instead of saying North,

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:13.080
what we want to stay is direction.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.890
And here instead of just logging or showing 200,

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:24.524
what we want to say is let's say math.round(coords.altitude),

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:29.385
and then what we're going to do is we are going to times that by

00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:35.759
3.2808 in order to convert that in to feet.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.024
And then same thing with miles per hour,

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:46.920
what we will do is coords.speed times 2.2369,

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.709
I believe if I remember my physics classes.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.875
And then what we're going to say is.tofixed(1),

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:57.115
and that's going to convert it into miles per hour.

00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:59.335
So let's go ahead and see if this works.

00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:01.349
All right there we go. You'll notice here that

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.835
my simulator is changing the miles per hour.

00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:10.230
The way you can do that is if you go to hardware and then you go over to debug,

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.965
head down to location and notice you can select your location here.

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:18.710
So I'm doing a city bicycle ride because I'm going roughly at 60 miles an hour.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.165
Notice if I went on a freeway drive,

00:03:21.164 --> 00:03:26.500
what's going to happen is my speed should eventually increase.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.780
What's also cool about this too is,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.090
there it goes and it changes directions as well.
