00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
All right. So this is where things start to get

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.189
fun if you have not been having fun already.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.740
So what we are going to do now is build out this view.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.759
You will notice here that what we are doing is this is kind of like a live detailed view.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.349
What we are doing is we are pulling information

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.209
from the phone in order to render this view.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.620
So it shows which way we are heading,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.780
the altitude, the current speed.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.140
All of this is going to be coming from your phone.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.429
So in order to do that, we actually need to go ahead and

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.300
use the phone's API to get that information.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.650
And one side note, if you are trying to do this on Android in the

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.664
simulator,is probably not going to work for some reason.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.490
The Android simulator does not work with what we are doing,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.030
but if you have it on a actual real device using the Expo app, you will be fine.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.105
So you either forget about the Android emulator and use the Expo app

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:45.469
or the iOS simulator. All right. Let us jump into it.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.640
So what we are going to do is,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.369
this new view is going to be called Live.js.

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:54.719
What we are going to have for now is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.153
just react in a component and then we will import the View,

00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:03.570
Text and this thing called ActivityIndicator,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.459
which are all coming from react-native.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:13.034
And then we will go ahead and export this class which extends component.

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:16.379
So what state this component is going to have,

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:20.155
it is going to have some coordinates which are set to null initially.

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:22.945
It is going to have a status which we will also set to

00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:27.204
null and a direction which is just going to be an empty string.

00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:34.030
So what we can do is we can grab this information off of the state.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.140
And then there are a few different views that we are going to get

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.310
depending on the specific permissions that you are granted.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.564
So what we are going to say is if status equals null,

00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:48.495
so the user really has not given us any permissions yet,

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:50.820
nothing has changed from the default state,

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.024
then what we want to do is render an ActivityIndicator,

00:01:56.025 --> 00:01:59.160
and we will give it a margin top of 30.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.729
All in ActivityIndicator is it's basically a loading spinners.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.670
So you've seen it before. It's just going render a spinner like,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.200
"Hey, we are waiting on something."

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.770
If the status equals denied,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.880
meaning you asked for permission and they did not give it to you,

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:22.764
what we are going to do for now is just render a view with some text in that says denied,

00:02:22.764 --> 00:02:35.615
and then we are going to do this exact same thing,

00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:38.254
but instead of denied,

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:41.914
it is going to be for undetermined.

00:02:41.914 --> 00:02:44.929
And when you are messing around with the simulator, again,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.790
some of these permissions are going to be a little bit

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.314
wonky because we are not on an actual real device,

00:02:50.314 --> 00:02:53.375
but we will get to that when we get to that.

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:57.800
And then lastly, if it is not denied or undetermined,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.020
that means it was granted.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.909
So what we will say is,

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.355
we will render a view,

00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:05.329
and then for now,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.965
what we are going to do is we will render a few text components.

00:03:08.965 --> 00:03:11.120
We will just go ahead and show the state for now,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.849
and this looks pretty good.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.875
So let us go ahead and add this as a new tab.

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:20.055
So inside of App.js,

00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:21.800
first, we need to import it.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.915
And next, what we need to do is inside of tabs,

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.204
let us go ahead and add any property.

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:30.615
We will call it Live,

00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:32.425
and just as we have done before,

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:36.210
screen is going to be the Live component.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.862
Some options here, the tabBarLabe,

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:43.055
we're just going to just say Live,

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:45.230
and then I am actually just going to copy

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:49.129
this one because we are also going to use Ionicon font,

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:56.305
but the name of this one is going to be ios-speedometer.

00:03:56.305 --> 00:03:58.835
All right, let us see if this is working.

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:01.180
So we got a Live.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.486
Notice, we get an indicator.

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:08.704
That is because the current status is set to null,

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:11.705
so we can just assume that this is working for sure.

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:13.670
We can set it to denied.

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.729
Now, what we should see it is denied up here.

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.327
All right. Let's set this back to null,

00:04:17.327 --> 00:04:20.409
and we will continue building this out in future videos.
