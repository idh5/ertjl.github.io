If you've ever uploaded an app to either the Google Play Store or the iOS App Store,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.134
you know that what you need to do is build your app and basically bundle it to,

00:00:10.134 --> 00:00:12.144
if you're on Android a.apk file,

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.824
or if you're on iOS a.ipa file.

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:16.344
So that's what we're going to do in this video,

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:18.899
we're not going to actually walk through how to upload

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.274
an app to the App Store just because it's kind of a long process.

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:25.469
But what we will walk through is the toughest part of that process,

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.469
which is building or bundling these specific files

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.769
that you need to actually upload to the app stores.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.469
So the very first thing we're going to do is head over to your terminal,

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.189
and if you don't already have the EXP app from Expo,

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:44.604
go ahead and install that as a global module on your computer.

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:46.314
I already have it so I'm not going to install it.

00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:47.519
But if you don't have it, run

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.460
mpminstall-G.exp and then once you have that what you can do,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.329
assuming your app is currently running and assuming you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.000
have updated your app.json file which we did in a previous video,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.019
what you can do now is if you're inside of your project,

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:10.439
you can run EXP, build,

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.509
call an Android or call an iOS depending on what you want to build for,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.950
I want to build for Android right now.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740
So we run that,

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:22.045
and then it's eventually going to ask you this question.

00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:25.840
Would you like to upload a key store or have us generate one for you?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.615
If you don't know what this means, let us handle it.

00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:32.259
What that means is I am very gladly going to let them handle it,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.785
so I'm going to say one,

00:01:34.784 --> 00:01:37.700
let Expo handle the process.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.670
After a few minutes you're going to get a view that looks like this,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.310
saying hey we went ahead and started building it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.010
because it's going to take forever or it's going to take a little bit while,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.620
you can go ahead and monitor the build by running EXP build call status.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.725
And if we do that, you'll notice that we get some warnings, which is fine.

00:01:56.724 --> 00:01:59.349
And it says hey your project looks good,

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.099
checking if current build exists.

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.269
And then it says the build is still in progress,

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:06.869
so wait a little bit longer.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.450
Now, after about 15 minutes when you run the build status command,

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.339
you'll get this URL right here.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.814
Now what you can do is enter in this URL into your browser,

00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:22.050
and that will allow you to download your.apk file,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.810
and then when you are submitting your apps to the app store,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.765
when they ask you for your.apk file,

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:31.794
you can just give them this file right here that you downloaded from this URL.

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:36.629
Now if you want to do that exact same process but for iOS,

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.179
all you need to do is run EXP build:iOS.,

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:46.000
and that will give you a.ipa file to upload when the iOS App Store asks you for that.
