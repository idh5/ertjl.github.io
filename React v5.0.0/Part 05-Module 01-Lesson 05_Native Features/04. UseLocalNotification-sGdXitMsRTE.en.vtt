00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
So now that we actually have

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.455
our function that's going to set the local notification for us,

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:09.384
what we want to do is we want to be able to invoke it so we can set it.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:15.580
So inside of app.JS what we can do is let's import that function,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.339
set local notification, which is coming from utils/helpers.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.030
And then when our main component mounts,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.539
what we want to do is we don't really need to return

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.714
anything we can just call set local notification.

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:35.453
So you'll notice when the app first loads it says, hey,

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:37.189
Expo wants to send you notifications.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:38.590
We'll say okay.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.290
And now every day at 8 o'clock we are going to get a local notification,

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.629
a notification that pops up right here saying hey,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.740
make sure you log your stats,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.890
and again that's only going to happen if the user hasn't already

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.189
logged their stats which we need to do right now,

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:56.390
because we haven't set up that functionality yet.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.870
So we can do that by going to our add entry component,

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.355
which is the very first component we worked on.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:09.590
We can import a few different things here.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.865
Let's see, this is coming from helpers.

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:15.884
Right here, notice we're already grabbing three things from helpers,

00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:18.100
we're just going to go ahead and grab two more.

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:24.009
The first one is going to be clear local notifications,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.685
and the second one is going to be set local notification.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:32.125
So now what we want to do whenever the user

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.364
inputs their information or their stats for the current day,

00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:42.164
we want to go ahead and clear the local notification and set up a new one for tomorrow.

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:48.430
So the way we can do that is inside of this submit function and if you remember,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.430
we have this note to ourself.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.005
And then we can call clear local notification.

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:57.729
And when that's finished,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.415
we can go ahead and just set up another one which will set up

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:04.000
a notification for tomorrow at 8 o'clock.
