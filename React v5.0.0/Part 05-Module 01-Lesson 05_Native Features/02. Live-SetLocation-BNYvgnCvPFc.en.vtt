00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.549
All right. So now for the fun part,

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.740
what we're going to do in this video is we're actually going

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.539
to ask the user for permission,

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:14.529
set their location and then show real time data here rather than just this dummy data.

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.524
So the very first thing we're going to do,

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:19.674
is we need to import a few things,

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:24.024
location and permissions which are both coming from expo,

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:31.004
and then also calculate direction which is coming from utils/helpers.

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:37.039
So the very first thing we want to do is let's make a method called setLocation.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.960
This method is going to be called when we have

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.554
confirmed that we have the correct permissions to get their location.

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:52.875
So what we're going to do here is we're going to call Location.watchPositionAsync.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:57.480
And what we want to do is pass this a few different options.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.449
We will say enable high accuracy to be true because we

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.740
care about the very small changes in the phone's location.

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:08.674
Time interval, we're going to set to one,

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:12.310
and distance interval, we're going to set to one.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.939
The reason we're doing this is just this is how often it updates,

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.117
and I don't really know the minimum amount,

00:01:18.117 --> 00:01:20.766
so I just put one because we want this to update,

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:24.005
we want their location update as quickly as possible.

00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:29.439
So now what we're going to do is we are going to pass a callback function as

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.914
the second argument to watchPositionAsync

00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:35.560
because whenever the position of the phone changes,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.275
this function is going to get called,

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:41.230
and we are going to get past the phones coordinates.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.395
So now what we can do is we'll come in here and we'll say newDirection equals,

00:01:45.394 --> 00:01:50.349
we'll just calculate the direction passing it, coords.heading.

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:54.914
So this is going to return us like North-North-East, something like that.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:59.969
And then now, we will also get the direction from this.states.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.840
And then what we will do,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.085
and the reason we're doing this is you will see in a future video,

00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:06.879
but we're going to do that for now,

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:09.810
and now what we want to do is setStates,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.689
and what we are going to do here,

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.245
is we're going to update state with state with the coordinates,

00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:24.515
with the status of granted and with the direction being the newDirection.

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:27.429
So now we have setLocation but what we want to do

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.923
before that is inside of component did mount,

00:02:30.923 --> 00:02:33.039
we need to make sure that we have

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.034
the correct permissions or we need to ask the user for these permissions.

00:02:37.034 --> 00:02:41.889
So what we can do is we can call permissions.getAsync,

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:48.534
and the permission we care about is permissions.LOCATION, all caps.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:51.669
And then, what's going to happen is we will be

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.954
past an object which has a status property.

00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:58.825
If the status, as you've seen before,

00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:04.310
is granted, then what we want to do is call setLocation.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.555
So if we ask them permission, they grant the permission,

00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:10.750
or we've already been granted permission,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.615
then go ahead and set the location.

00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:20.650
If not, then what we want to do is say setStates and just update the status.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.730
If there is any issue here,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.074
what we want to do is let's catch that error,

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:29.649
and then we will say counsel.worn.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.645
Let's say Error getting Location permission to show the error.

00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:38.080
And then we will update setStates,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.130
and we will just say our status is undetermined.

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.590
All right, so let's see if this is working.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.099
I reset all of the settings in my simulator

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.400
just because I wanted to show from a fresh start of what would happen.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.240
And super big buzzkill,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.760
I can't find variable permissions because we called

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:08.560
this permission instead of permissions and now all of this should work.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.469
All right, got it, expo.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.990
All right, so now let's go to the live tab, oh, buzzkill.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.730
So you'll notice here that we are getting

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.340
this screen saying we need to enable location services.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.664
The reason we're getting this is because when the come on amounts,

00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:24.050
we are saying hey,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.525
do we have permission?

00:04:25.524 --> 00:04:29.179
Like get the permission of these location services.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.525
If it's granted already,

00:04:30.524 --> 00:04:32.239
then set the location.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.514
If it's not granted,

00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:36.509
then just set the status to whatever it is.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.634
So we're never actually asking them for permission.

00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:42.829
So that's what we're going to do in the next video,

00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:46.669
is to learn how to ask the user for permissions. So that way.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.259
Here, if it's not granted,

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.810
we can ask them permission and we can also

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.000
ask them permission when they click on this button right here.
