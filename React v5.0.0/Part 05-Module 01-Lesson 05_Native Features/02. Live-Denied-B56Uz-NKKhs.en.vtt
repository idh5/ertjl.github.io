00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.189
Now, what if instead of being undetermined,

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:05.529
the status is denied.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.109
So, the user straight up denied the notification to get,

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.594
or to give access to their location.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:17.670
So, what we'll do in this case is we also want to center this.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.750
We're going to use this exact same icon which I like.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.000
And then, below what we will do is

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.949
instead of saying you need to enable location services for this app,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.189
we will say you denied your location.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:43.754
You can fix this by visiting your settings and enabling location services for this app.

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:45.390
So this one's pretty straightforward.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.605
Now, what we will see when we go to our live view is this text right here.

00:00:50.604 --> 00:00:54.459
Again, this is just the UIS. So, if the user denies us we say,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.320
"Hey, there's nothing we can really do for you because you denied us."
