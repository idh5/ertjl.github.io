00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
All right, let's do some more fun stuff.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:07.250
So what I want to do in this video is I want to add some animations to the specific text.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.780
So whenever this text or whichever direction we are heading changes,

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:16.574
I want to go ahead and animate that change and kind of bounce the text a little bit.

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:20.899
So what we'll do is we're going to use react-native's animated library.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.375
The very first thing we're going to do is add

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:27.259
a bounce value to our state which is going to be

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.880
a new instance of calling animated.value with a capital v and passing in once.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.945
The bounceValue is going to start at one.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:40.890
And then what we're going to do is down here.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.285
Let's see inside of set location.

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:47.839
The reason we set it up like this is because what I want to do here is,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.320
and this is where we're going to determine if the specific direction we're heading has

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.750
changed because we have the old direction and then we also have the new direction.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.619
So what we can say, is we can say if new direction does not equal the old direction,

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.250
then what we want to do is we want to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.310
take our bounceValue and we want to animate it a little bit.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.030
So what we can do is we can say Animated.sequence

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.155
meaning we're going to have a sequence of animations.

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:17.355
We're going to pass in an array.

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:21.825
The very first animation we're going to do is it's going to be timed,

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:24.799
so using Animated.timing what we

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.244
want to animate or what we want to change is the bounceValue.

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:32.660
And then we want this to take 200 milliseconds,

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:41.500
and we want to go from an initial value that we set at 1 to 1.04.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.814
So that sounds small but you'll see it in action here in a second.

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:48.980
And then once that's complete what we want to do is we want

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.935
to do a spring animation on our bounceValue again.

00:01:53.935 --> 00:02:01.605
And now what we want to do is go back to a value of one with a friction of four.

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:02.719
So what's going to happen here,

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.359
our bounceValue is going to start at one.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.429
When the location changes,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.444
we're going to take it from one, time it,

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:13.359
taking 200 milliseconds up to 1.04,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.870
and then take it back down to one using a spring.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.420
And what you always need to remember is that

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.209
with animations you need to call.start on them.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.655
So now what's going to happen right now is bounceValue

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:35.240
is undefined that's because we need to come in here and say bounceValue.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.300
So we shouldn't see anything just yet because we haven't

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.260
actually tied up this bounceValue to our UI.

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.679
So what we can do is down here inside

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.280
of our end of component where we're going to use this instead,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.479
where is that? Right here.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.409
Instead of having just text components what we can say

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.819
is we want these to be Animated.Text components,

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.965
we just want to bring this down.

00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:07.150
And then now what we want to do is we want it to

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.004
have the style that it had which was styles that direction,

00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:14.444
but we also want to give it a transform.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:18.094
So the way that will look is something like this, we'll say transform,

00:03:18.094 --> 00:03:24.030
we'll pass it an array and we want it to scale with our bounceValue.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.939
So now as the bounceValue is changing that's going to

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.764
scale and transform this specific text.

00:03:32.764 --> 00:03:35.194
So that looks pretty good to me,

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:36.599
I think that is it.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.060
We need real quick up here to grab bounceValue off of this state.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.805
All right, it looks good. Let's go ahead and test this out.

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:48.110
So I'm going to go here.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.600
So you'll notice right away it changed from west to northwest and we got that animation.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.159
Let's wait a few more seconds,

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.009
hopefully we'll get another direction change here as

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:01.024
we're on the freeway going 75 miles per hour.

00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:03.810
There we go. We went back to west and you'll notice

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.969
we got the subtle little animation change there.
