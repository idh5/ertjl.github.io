A nice addition to the app we've been building would be a way for

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.925
the user to track their current speed, elevation and direction.

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:13.474
To do this, we'll need to subscribe to the devices geolocation information.

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:18.309
Luckily for us, Expo provides us with a location API which has a

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.664
get current position async method

00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:24.000
which we'll use to get exactly the information we'll need.
