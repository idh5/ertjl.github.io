00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So what I want to do in this video is style and add

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
some UI to this undetermined section right here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.219
So what we'll do is let's just set the status to undetermined that we can see this,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.609
and then I'm going to import a few things.

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.550
Let's get TouchableOpacity in here,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.560
as well as StyleSheets.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:26.125
We're also going to import foundation from our expo icons.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.362
And then finally, let's go and get some colors.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:32.699
We'll get purple, as well as whites. All right.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.859
So what I'm going to do is just paste in some styles here

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:39.530
because you've seen me do enough styles in this course.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.829
So we have a container, a center which is just

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.939
centering everything horizontally and vertically.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:46.044
A button, which is purple,

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:48.524
looks nice, as well as some button text.

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:51.295
So what we're going to do now is inside of undetermined,

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.789
instead of just saying undetermined,

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.582
what we can do is,

00:00:56.582 --> 00:01:02.237
let's add styles.center, so we want to center this both horizontally and vertically.

00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:04.609
And then, we will have the foundation icon.

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:07.269
Name is going to be alert,

00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:08.979
because we're going to say,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.700
why did you deny us?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.805
You should have accepted us so that we can show you this cool UI.

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:20.200
So what we'll do now is we will do just that and we will say you

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.165
need to enable location services for this app.

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:30.430
And then here, what we will do is we will have our button, onPress.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.980
We will create a method called,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.215
askPermission, which will do just that.

00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:37.795
Style is going to be styles.button.

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:40.030
And then inside of this,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.040
we can say, enable.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.835
And we want to style this with the styles.button text,

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.479
which we created earlier. This looks good.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.875
Let's go ahead and create just a placeholder for askPermission right now.

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:58.629
And now, what should happen is if everything is good,

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:02.405
when we click on live we get this UI here.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:07.495
So this is the UI again for if the status is undetermined,

00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:09.189
we're going to go ahead and say, hey,

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:13.324
you need to enable location services for this application.

00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:16.375
Click here, and eventually what that should do is open up a dialog saying,

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:20.430
hey, go ahead and get this app permission to track your location.
