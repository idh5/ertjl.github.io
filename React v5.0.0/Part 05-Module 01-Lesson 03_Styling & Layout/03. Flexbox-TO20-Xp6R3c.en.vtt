00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.309
We've talked about how React Native uses CSS in JS for

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:08.839
adding styling to your application and specifically, to your components.

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:10.679
What we haven't talked about,

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.987
is how React Native handles layout.

00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:15.439
If you've been building for the web for awhile,

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.144
you're probably familiar with the idea of the block model and floats.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:22.804
According to MDN, the float CSS property

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:27.704
specifies that an element should be placed along the left or right side of its container,

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.794
where text and inline elements will wrap around it.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:36.609
In other words, floats lying to specify how elements are placed related to each other.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.211
If you've been keeping up to date with the layout options in CSS for the last few years,

00:00:40.212 --> 00:00:42.785
you've probably heard of flexbox.

00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:44.539
Again, according to MDN,

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.659
flexbox is a layout mode intended to

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.769
accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.875
For many applications, the flexible box model is

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:59.019
easier than the block model since it does not use floats.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.455
Flexbox is essentially a replacement on the old block model approach to layout.

00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:05.090
And one, that in mind,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.915
many other people's opinion is much better.

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:10.760
So naturally, react native chose to implement

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.005
flexbox for the layout over the original block model.

00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.339
If you don't know flexbox, don't worry.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.174
The whole next section is dedicated to help you learn it.

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:22.219
Now, if you do know what it is, you're pretty good shape.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.739
There are however, some small differences between

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:27.019
the official flexbox specification in

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:30.000
react native implementation. We'll cover that as well.
