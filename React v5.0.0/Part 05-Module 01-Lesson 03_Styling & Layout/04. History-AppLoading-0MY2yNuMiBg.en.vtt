00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
All right, so our app is looking pretty good here but you'll notice what happens,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.783
and this is especially true on Android,

00:00:07.783 --> 00:00:10.030
when I hit refresh,

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.129
you notice there's some wonky stuff going on here.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.475
We get this screen right here and then it goes into the app.

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:21.100
What we want to do instead is we kind of want to minimize that chink.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.450
So until the app is ready,

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.859
we want to show a loading screen.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.794
So what we can do is inside of our history file,

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:35.170
we can import this component called AppLoading from expo.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:43.340
And then now what we can do is we can come down here and say ready set to false.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.440
So now we have a property on our state called ready,

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:50.039
and inside of render what we can do,

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.549
let's go ahead and grab that ready property from our state.

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:57.684
And then now, we can say if ready equals false,

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:02.045
what we want to do is return AppLoading.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:04.135
So until we are ready,

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:07.170
go ahead and show this loading component,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.859
and then now we need to figure out,

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:14.920
or we need to tell and update ready once the app is actually ready with all of the data.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.245
So what we can do is,

00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:23.185
right here, we can just chain on another.then and we can say,

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:25.570
when all of this happens,

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:26.949
when that's all finished,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.935
go ahead and run this.setState,

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:32.750
set ready to true.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.609
Now, this isn't going to fix all of our issues because this is going to get

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.355
called immediately after this function resolves.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:42.745
But it does get us a little bit closer.

00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:45.829
So you'll see here when our app refreshes,

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.957
there is still a little bit of that flash here,

00:01:48.957 --> 00:01:51.000
but it is a little bit better.
