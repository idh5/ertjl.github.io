00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
We've talked over and over again how each platform,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.320
whether it's iOS or Android has their own unique feel,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.405
and their own unique style to it.

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:09.919
And when you're building an app,

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.195
you really need to keep that in mind.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.365
One example we saw earlier when we were building out our icon,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:19.264
I searched for the icon pizza,

00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:23.410
and the pizza that we used was the iOS-pizza.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.969
Now you'll notice here there are a few different pizzas,

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:27.529
this is the iOS-pizza obviously,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.950
and this is the MD-pizza or the Material Design pizza.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.530
Now, it doesn't make sense to have an iOS pizza on an Android device.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.020
What we should have instead,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.700
is we should have the Material Design pizza.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.035
If you had a user using this,

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:53.329
they might be offended that you're using an iOS pizza on an Android device,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.789
they expect their experience to be more Androidy, more Material Designy.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.598
So what we can do to fix this is React Native has this platform property.

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:08.884
And so in here what we can do is we can say if

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:16.475
Platform.OS is iOS then what we want to do is show them the iOS-pizza,

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:19.579
and if it's not meaning it's Android,

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.769
then what we want to do is show them the md-pizza.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:28.944
So now what's going to happen when our apps refresh,

00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:33.634
notice we have the distinct pizza for the distinct platform

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:40.670
because we are using Platform.OS in order to detect which platform we're on.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.644
We can also do this exact same things with styles if we want to.

00:01:44.644 --> 00:01:48.429
Imagine these were class names here with our stylesheet,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.370
we can say if we're on iOS go ahead and apply the iOS button,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.000
if we're not then go ahead and apply the Android button.
