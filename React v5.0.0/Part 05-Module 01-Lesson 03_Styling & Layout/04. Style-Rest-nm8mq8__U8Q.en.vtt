00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
We're almost done styling our ad entry view,

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.779
there are just a few notable changes that we need to make.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.550
One is our slider right here as well as the metrics below it.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.600
Our date and then also,

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.629
we need to style our reset button right here.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.359
So let's go ahead and get started on that.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.035
First, let's do the DateHeader since that's a pretty small one.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.629
What we will do is,

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:28.099
let's just go ahead and add an inline style here.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.540
We'll give it a color of purple which we will import here in a second,

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.879
and we will say fontSize 25.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.745
So now, we will import purple.

00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:42.344
This is coming from utils dot colors.

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:47.549
So now, notice this is nice and styled, our DateHeader.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:54.464
Next, let's go ahead and do our slider which is located in UdaciSlider.

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:58.230
So first, what we need to do is import

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:03.669
StyleSheet and we will also import gray from our colors.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.390
So what we want to do here is we want to have these items be laid out in a row,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.344
like we've talked about with the other components as well.

00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:17.200
So what we can do is create a style sheet,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.230
give it a row property,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.380
which will set the main flexDirection to be row,

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:28.634
flex 1 again and then alignItems in the center.

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:32.820
And then, we'll use metricCounter again as we've done before,

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.009
we'll give it a width of 85.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.280
And then we will justify the content along

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.840
the center as well as alignItems along the center.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.765
So now, all we need to do is we will come up here,

00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:51.284
and we will apply our metricCounter to this view right here.

00:01:51.284 --> 00:01:55.194
To this view, we will apply styles.row,

00:01:55.194 --> 00:02:00.915
and then we will give some inline styles to these two text components.

00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:03.750
Say, fontSize of 24,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.819
textAlign center, and something similar here.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.870
We will say fontSize of 18 and then a color of gray.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.210
Now, you may have noticed that this section,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.490
and specifically these styles,

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.844
are very similar to what we did in our Steppers file.

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:22.680
If you wanted to consolidate these,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.830
you could make a single object somewhere and just

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.805
import that into both of these components,

00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:34.080
and then you would basically not be duplicating the styles here.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.170
I'm not a huge fan of that just because I feel like eventually,

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:38.609
if we need to change one of them,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.750
we would have to then, decouple those.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.625
But again, it's up to you.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:45.530
So what we want to do with our slider,

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.189
you'll notice that it's not taking up the full space of it's parents.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.145
So to fix that, what we can do is we can come in here and give this a flex of one.

00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:59.340
So that's why I keep talking about whenever you have,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.354
or whenever you want a component to take up the full space of its parent,

00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:04.679
you need to give it a flex of one,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.395
which will now make it look like this.

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:09.510
So, that looks great.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:13.449
The very last thing we need to do is just style this reset button right here,

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.169
that is located inside of TextButton,

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.634
so what we do is we're going to need the color purple,

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:26.064
and let's also go ahead and import StyleSheet while we're here.

00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:28.389
We'll create some styles,

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.074
let's say, we'll have a reset property.

00:03:32.074 --> 00:03:35.849
And what we're going to do is we'll say textAlign center,

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.375
we could have just inline these but we'll go ahead and use StyleSheet for this.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:41.324
Color is going to be purple,

00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:43.229
and then up here,

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:50.009
what we're going to do is we're going to say style is going to equal styles.reset,

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.724
and eventually, what I want to be able to do is

00:03:52.724 --> 00:03:56.139
I want to be able to pass in Styles as a prop.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.559
So what we'll do is we'll say,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.555
if styles undefined, set it equal to an empty object.

00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:04.530
But instead of just applying styles.reset,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.935
I also want to be able to apply style,

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:10.670
which is coming from the prop again.

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.019
So now, just one small change real quick,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.285
that's going to be./utils.

00:04:18.285 --> 00:04:21.300
And so now, if we look at this view,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.000
you'll notice our reset button is nice and styled and we can go ahead and click it.
