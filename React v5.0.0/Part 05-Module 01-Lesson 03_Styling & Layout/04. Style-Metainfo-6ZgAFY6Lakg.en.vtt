00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
Now, what we can do is we can finally start styling our application.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.230
So what we're going to do is we're going to go back and

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.950
style all of the components that we initially didn't style.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.619
There are a few different ways to approach this.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.364
If you are comfortable with flexbox or if you just want a challenge,

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:17.109
go ahead and try to do this on your own.

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.234
And then once you do that, you can come back and watch me do it,

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:21.439
or you can just skip this entirely.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.807
If you're not super comfortable,

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:24.674
then you can go ahead and watch me go through it.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:26.210
So the very first thing we're going to do is in App.js,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.589
the only style we're going to add here is we're

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.210
going to give this parent view a flex of one.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.700
The reason we're doing that is we're saying we

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.995
want this component to take up all the available space,

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:46.909
so that way, any children components will be able to expand the full size of the phone.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.519
Without this, that wouldn't be possible.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.670
Next, let's go ahead and style all of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.679
the components inside of our getMetricMetaInfo function.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.394
So to do this, let's go ahead, and up here,

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:05.204
let's import StyleSheet, and then we're also going to import some more colors.

00:01:05.204 --> 00:01:08.390
Say, red, orange, blue,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.015
light purple, as well as pink.

00:01:12.015 --> 00:01:14.564
And then now, what we can do is down here,

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:17.509
let's go ahead and create some styles.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.840
We're going to use the StyleSheet.create API.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.631
And let's just go ahead and we'll have iconContainer.

00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:30.659
So this is going to be the container around the icon or this view right here.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.390
So what we want to do is,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.299
let's go ahead and give it a padding of five.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.500
We'll say borderRadius.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.079
Let's give that eight.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.594
Width and height are going to be set to 50.

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:44.870
We want everything inside of it to be aligned on

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.895
the main axes in the center as well as the cross axes.

00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:56.959
And then we'll just give it a marginRight of 20 pixels.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.489
So now, what we can do is,

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:03.709
let's go ahead and select every view inside of this document,

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.655
and we will give it this iconContainer styles,

00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:09.694
but we're also going to give it something else.

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.555
So we can pass style in array.

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:18.890
The first styles that are going to be added to this component is our iconContainer,

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.784
which is coming from styles.iconContainer.

00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:24.129
And then what we want to do is we want to have

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.449
each of these have their own background color.

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.264
So let's come up here, and we'll say backgroundColor,

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:33.404
and we will just give all of them red for now.

00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:36.985
So getIcon for running,

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:38.975
let's go ahead and set that to red.

00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:40.909
And then for biking,

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.829
let's set this to orange.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.200
For swimming, we'll say blue.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.560
For sleeping, we will say light purple.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.224
And then finally, we will say pink.

00:02:51.224 --> 00:02:53.824
So let's go ahead and take a look at what this looks like now.

00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:55.274
So it looks like we have a typo.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:03:02.205
alignItem should be alignItems up here inside of our styles. All right.

00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:04.243
So you'll notice here, this looks pretty good,

00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:08.659
but instead of having black as the actual icon color,

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.599
what we want to do is we want this to be white.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.164
And we just did this initially so that we could see the icon on the black background.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:19.939
So let's go ahead and set that to white, and again,

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.026
the reason we can type white as a variable is because we've imported it right here.

00:03:24.026 --> 00:03:27.380
And then now, notice that we have these icons,

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.000
and the icons themselves are white.
