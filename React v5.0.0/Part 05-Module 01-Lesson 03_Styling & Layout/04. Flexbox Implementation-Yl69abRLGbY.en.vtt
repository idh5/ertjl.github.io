00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439
React native uses Flexbox for its layout.

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.929
However, there are some minor differences between

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:10.379
the official Flexbox specification and React Native's implementation.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.380
For example, on the web,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.320
flex-direction defaults to row.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.800
In React Native, it defaults to column,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.830
since we're building for mobile devices.

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.659
These differences, along with other React Natives APIs related to styling,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.000
are all be covering in this section.
