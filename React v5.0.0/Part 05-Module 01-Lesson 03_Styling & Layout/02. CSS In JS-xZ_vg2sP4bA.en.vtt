00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
Remember when you first saw JSX?

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:07.379
You might have thought it was a little strange mixing markup into your JavaScript.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.240
But as you got more used to it,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.615
you probably learned to really like it.

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:14.970
React's separation of concern is at the component level,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.394
not at the technology level.

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:18.780
Now the question becomes,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.414
what are the concerns of a component?

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:22.904
Now, in my opinion,

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:27.685
a component has two primary concerns: state and presentation.

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:30.059
React components have local state,

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.859
and JSX manages the markup portion of the presentation.

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.575
But to me, presentation is more than just markup,

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:41.115
it's the combination of markup and styles.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:44.385
So I propose that we move our styles out of the style-sheets,

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:46.769
and into the component level.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.533
Now, it sounds crazy,

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.750
but it's actually a fairly common pattern in the React community.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.784
So much, that it's React Native's primary pattern for styling components.

00:00:56.784 --> 00:01:00.912
So, do we just have the CSS live inside of the component?

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:04.340
Well, this may seem weird to you if you're not used to the idea,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.130
but to style applications in React Native instead of using CSS as you used to,

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:12.144
you actually just use JavaScript.

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:14.000
Let's look at an example.
