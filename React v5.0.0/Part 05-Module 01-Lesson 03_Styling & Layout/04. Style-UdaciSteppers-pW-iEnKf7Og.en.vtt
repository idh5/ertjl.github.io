00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
Now, let's go ahead and style our Udacity Stepper component,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.490
which is this component right here.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.185
This one's actually pretty fun because if you'll notice,

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:11.589
on the final version, again,

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.169
as we've talked about the iOS version is very different

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.989
than the Android version so what we want to do

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:19.419
is we want to get these things positioned in

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.100
a row and then what we want to do is just style the buttons a little bit differently.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.525
Let's head over to our Udacity Steppers component,

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:34.359
and we need to go ahead and imports the style sheet as well as platform and then,

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.524
as I just barely talked about what we want to do,

00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:45.519
is we want to make sure that these items are displayed in a row rather than vertically.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.200
Eventually, what we'll have is we will have

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.345
different buttons for iOS and different buttons for Android.

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:54.240
Let's go ahead and just worry about the iOS versions for now.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.495
What we can do, as always,

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:59.829
is we can say styles is going to be whatever gets

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.579
returned from StyleSheet.create and first,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.164
let's create our row property.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.865
So, flexDirection to row,

00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:10.824
so now the main access is going to be

00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:16.530
horizontally say flex: 1 as always and then align items center.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.155
We are going to align the items vertically along the center.

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:24.519
What we want to do is up here,

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:30.789
we want to say style is going to be say styles.row and then what we

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.355
also want to do is we also want to say justifyContent space-between.

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:40.859
What's happening here, if this is a row,

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.150
so the main axis is horizontal,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.065
then justify content is going to align everything horizontally

00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:51.549
spaced out with space evenly between the items and then now,

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:52.974
what we can do here,

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:55.359
is we'll just do an inline style and we will

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.920
say flexDirection is going to be row as well,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.969
but without all of the stuff on it.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.795
Now, if we just save that, you'll notice,

00:02:04.795 --> 00:02:07.390
let's refresh Android, you'll notice that things

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.240
are aligned horizontally now which is good.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.550
Next, let's go ahead and make our iosBtn style,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.350
so we'll come down here and we'll say iosBtn.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.439
If you remember what it's going to look like is this right here.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.050
We will say the background is going to be white,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.525
and let's go ahead and import that real quick.

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:30.039
Eventually, we're going to need a few other colors as well,

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.829
so I'll do that right now.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.400
Just gray and purple,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.534
backgroundColor is going to be a white,

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:39.549
borderColor is going to be purple,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.100
borderWidth is going to be one,

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.155
borderRadius, let's go ahead and set that to let's say three.

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:48.659
We'll give it a padding of five,

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.969
and a paddingLeft of 25 as well as a paddingRight of 25.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:03.344
Now, let's apply our iosBtn to both of these touchable components right here.

00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:05.134
Right here, we will say style and

00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:08.530
style.iosBtn and then we will

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.145
do the exact same thing for this touchable component right here.

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:15.250
Now, let's take a look at what this looks like.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.439
We're getting there, it's a little bit closer,

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.829
you'll notice that right down the middle here,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.960
we still have that borderRadius.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.189
What we want to do is we want to make these flat rather than having a borderRadius.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.620
What we can do is,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.629
let's go ahead and pass an array to this first one.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.215
We want to apply all of these styles,

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:38.620
but we also want to come in here and we will say

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.210
borderTopRightRadius is going to be

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.685
zero and borderBottomRightRadius is also going to be zero.

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:49.240
Now, if we look at our app,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.545
you'll notice right here,

00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:57.269
that's flat as well as on the bottom and then we want to do the same thing down here.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.900
This will be an array and then we want to say on this one borderTopLeftRadius is zero,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.295
and borderBottomLeftRadius is also going to be zero,

00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:10.750
which should flatten those out a bit.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.264
I'm not sure whether it is bleeding right here.

00:04:13.264 --> 00:04:15.319
It looks like it's a bug with React Native.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.269
When I built this for production and the other version of the app, I didn't have that.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.524
I think it should be fine to not worry about that for right now.

00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:26.864
This looks pretty good as far as the iOS buttons are concerned.

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.470
Instead of using black, here,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.600
let's go ahead and iOS,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.260
or at least on this button, we'll use purple,

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.365
and then down here let's have purple as well.

00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:39.939
All right. That looks great.

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.060
Before we jump into styling for Android,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.370
let's go ahead and style our metrics right here.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.490
What we can do is,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.165
let's say this one is going to have,

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:59.319
we'll call it metricCounter and what that's going to have say width is going to be 85,

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:06.639
then we want to justify everything on the center using justifyContent and alignItems.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:13.319
Then now, let's go ahead and add some inline styles to the text components.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.685
Let's say font size of 24 on this one with textAlign center.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:24.285
On this one, all we will say is font size of 18 so it's a little bit smaller,

00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:27.865
and the color instead of being black is going to be gray.

00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:29.949
Now, let's see what that looks like.

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.539
That looks pretty good.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.635
Now, let's go ahead and style our Android buttons real quick.

00:05:36.634 --> 00:05:39.240
Down here, let's create a new property.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.915
We'll call it an androidBtn.

00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:44.140
What this is going to have?

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.849
It's going to be a lot simpler than the iOS one will just say margin of five.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.105
The backgroundColor is going to be purple,

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:56.050
give it some padding of 10 and then a borderRadius of two.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.620
Now, what we need to do is depending on what platform we're on,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.230
that's what style we need to apply.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.944
Up here, let's say,

00:06:07.944 --> 00:06:10.899
if the platform is iOS,

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:16.469
then what we want to do is render these components,

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.745
we fix the formatting here and then if it's not on iOS,

00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:26.889
just copy and paste this, render these components.

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:29.694
We do need to make some changes real quick.

00:06:29.694 --> 00:06:31.915
You'll notice if we look at the final version,

00:06:31.915 --> 00:06:36.310
these icons are actually a little bit thinner than these ones over here.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.750
The reason for that is because we are using a different component library.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.745
We'll say, if we're on iOS,

00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:46.545
instead of rendering FontAwesome icons.

00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:49.905
Let's go ahead and render these Entypo ones.

00:06:49.904 --> 00:06:51.964
We can still use minus and plus,

00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:54.159
still use the same sizes.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.439
Then now, down here FontAwesome works for Android,

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.844
but instead of iOS,

00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:03.300
we will say render our androidBtn styles.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.400
We have an error on line 36.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:11.435
It's because we're missing a curly brace right there.

00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:16.035
That's because we're missing a curly brace right there.

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:19.255
All right, this looks good.

00:07:19.254 --> 00:07:22.839
You'll notice on Android R, the color of our icons are purple.

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.214
We do not want that.

00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:26.924
We want them to be white.

00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:29.620
We can say it is down here,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.420
it's going to be whites.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:38.220
There we go, we now have our Android styles over here and our iOS styles over here.
