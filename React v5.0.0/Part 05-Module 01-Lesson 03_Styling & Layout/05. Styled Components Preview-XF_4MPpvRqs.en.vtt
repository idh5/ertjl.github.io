00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.679
What I want to do in this video is talk about an alternative to CSS and JS

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:09.320
that react-native provides you using the StyleSheet.create API,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.650
and that is a library called styled-components.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.259
Now, we're not going to use this throughout the course,

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.719
but I think it's interesting to know and be aware of it,

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:22.269
because it is starting to change the game a little bit as far as styling components goes.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:23.660
So what you need to do before you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.609
actually use this, is if you want to play around with it,

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.449
go ahead and NPM or Yarn add styled-components.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.195
And then, you will be able to do something like this,

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:38.105
where you can import styled from styled-components,

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:41.659
and on react-native, go ahead and do /native.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.074
Now, we have this styled object.

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:48.410
The whole idea of styled-components is that

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.369
your styles should really be a first class citizen of your component.

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.150
We've talked a little bit about that,

00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:57.460
but just as your component has state,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.859
your component should also have styles kind of captured inside of it.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.054
So, notice here what we have,

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:06.710
is we have this view with this container style,

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:08.449
which is just centering everything,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.310
and then we have this text.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.930
What if, instead of adding styles like this,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.090
what if we actually made a component where these styles were built into it?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.530
That's really the whole idea of styled-components.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.835
So what I want to do up here is let's create something called center view,

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:30.334
and then what we're going to do is we're going to call styled.View,

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:32.839
and then what we're going to do is there is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.250
this little tag template literal thing right here with these back ticks.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.844
This is actually an ES6 feature,

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:42.409
and what it allows us to do is now,

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.909
instead of writing our styles and Javascript with these objects,

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.923
we can actually just write kind of real CSS in here.

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:56.760
What I'm going to do is we will say flex:1 align-items center,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.585
notice that's, shouldn't be using commas,

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:05.772
and I'm not camelcasing anything because we're just writing this as if it is normal CSS.

00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:09.275
So we're going to say, justify-content center,

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:12.760
and then we will give it a background of 333.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:18.139
So now, center view is going to just be a react-native view component,

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.199
but now these styles are going to be built into it.

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:25.364
So now, instead of saying style=styles.container,

00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:27.965
we can actually just render a centerview,

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:31.370
which allows us to get rid of these styles down here.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.080
And now when we refresh our app,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.590
what we'll see is everything is the exact same because

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.460
this component just has these styles built into it.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.890
Let's take this a step further.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.474
We can come in here and we can say,

00:02:43.474 --> 00:02:47.884
WelcomeText is going to be style.Text,

00:02:47.884 --> 00:02:49.566
and then back ticks.

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:52.819
And then now, let's go ahead and transform this up

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.745
to here so we will say color is going to be white,

00:02:56.745 --> 00:03:00.349
and let's give it a font-size of 20 as well.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.769
And so now, instead of having this text,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.890
we can come in here and we can say centerview,

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.869
except we want to say,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.310
WelcomeText, and down here,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.900
we will close WelcomeText.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.105
And now, we can just say,

00:03:14.104 --> 00:03:16.274
Hello, and everything is the same,

00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:19.865
just so I can prove this is different.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:27.100
There we go. So you'll notice the styling is just built in to the component itself.

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.509
Let's take this one step further.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.149
Say we had a button that we wanted to

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.680
use and we wanted to add these styles to the button.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.510
What we can do is let's say,

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:42.104
WelcomeBtn, and we can use styled.TouchableOpacity.

00:03:42.104 --> 00:03:45.629
And then this button is going to have a few different properties on it.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.310
We'll say, width is 100 pixels,

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.650
height is going to be 50 pixels, backgrounds is red.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.930
Notice, this is just like we're typing CSS here so if you have

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.560
been hating on CSS and JS this whole time,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.840
you should be very happy with styled-components and you can

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.224
actually go ahead and use styled-components throughout the rest of the course.

00:04:04.224 --> 00:04:06.025
I won't, but if you want to,

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:08.615
by all means, you will learn a lot doing it.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.560
Then we have alignItems center as well.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.560
S now, what I want to do is let's go ahead and render our WelcomeBtn and so now,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.310
the question is what do I do,

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.819
where do I add the onPress prop?

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.000
Well, we can do that, just on the component itself.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.790
Any props that you pass to a styled-component is

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.910
just going to be passed through to the real component.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.370
So in here, what we will say is,

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.000
we will alert Hello,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and then let's say, PUSH ME.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.290
So if everything is working correctly, there we go.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.764
When we push, notice we get Hello.

00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:48.410
But now, just one last change.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.870
Instead of using the text component,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.959
let's just go ahead and reuse our WelcomeText component that we built earlier up here,

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:00.064
so that we can get these styles and we will just say,

00:05:00.064 --> 00:05:04.870
PUSH ME, and there we go.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.870
So what we've done is we've taken this idea of adding

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.410
CSS into our components one step further and now,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.075
they're actually built into the components themselves.

00:05:15.074 --> 00:05:18.610
So if you haven't looked at either styled-components, glamorous,

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.715
they're all really similar,

00:05:19.714 --> 00:05:23.000
definitely check it out because it's a really interesting space right now.
