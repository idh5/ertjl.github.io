00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.879
Now the next step,

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.750
is to style this section right here where we have the day.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.875
So what we are going to do is we're actually going to make our own component for this,

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:13.140
we will call it metric card.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.000
And then, what we're going to do is, we'll need react.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.089
The react native components we will need,

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.269
new style sheet as well as text,

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.230
which are all coming from react native.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.230
And then, we will need our date header component.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.465
We're going to go ahead and grab,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:37.400
get metric meta info from our helper's file.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:45.820
Then at last, what we need is our grey color which is coming from you utils/colors.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.530
This is going to be a state less functional component.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.560
It's going to take in a date as well as all of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.165
the metrics and we are going to return a view.

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:00.859
So now we're going to do is,

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.109
if there is a date,

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.935
then we are going to render our date header,

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:09.045
passing it the specific date.

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:11.030
But if there is not a date,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.474
then we do not want to render anything.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.699
Next, what we're going to do is,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.204
we're going to say object.keys

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:25.625
metrics which will give us an array with all of the items being the keys in metrics,

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:28.370
and then we're going to call dot map on that.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.770
We've seen this before and then from here,

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:33.409
this will be the metric.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.819
And now what we're going to do is,

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.084
we will say get icon,

00:01:37.084 --> 00:01:44.079
display name, get all these properties off of that unit as well as background color.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.769
It's going to be coming from whatever we get return from

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:52.009
get metric meta info passing it the specific metric.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.454
And then the UI for this section,

00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:57.094
is going to be a view.

00:01:57.094 --> 00:02:04.489
Let's go ahead and give this a style of styles.metric and a key,

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:08.289
because we are mapping the key is going to be the metric itself.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.769
So let's go ahead and make that style real quick.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.409
So this is going to be pretty small,

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.259
all is going to say as we will set flex direction to

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:24.185
row and then we will give margin top of 12.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.789
So now what we're going to do is,

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.539
we want to call get icon.

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.522
So that's going to show the icon for that specific metric.

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:37.085
And then we will have another view section down here and what we want to show and again,

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:40.474
all we're doing is we're recreating this section right here.

00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:44.824
So what we want to show is the display name.

00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:49.334
Let's give this a font size of 20.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.150
And then below this what we want to do,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.375
so here we have the display name.

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:58.650
Below it, we want to show the specific value and the unit.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.319
So what we can do is,

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.354
we will say metrics at metric,

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:08.959
then we will say unit and then now what we want to do is,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.939
let's say font Size 16 color is going to be grey.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.234
I think that looks pretty good.

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:20.945
Now what we need to do is,

00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:25.229
import metric card inside of our history file.

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:30.304
Then now instead of just rendering this right here,

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:32.030
what we can do is,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.800
we will say a metric card.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.700
Metrics is going to be metrics which we're getting right

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.644
here and then let's go ahead and pass it the date,

00:03:41.645 --> 00:03:46.115
which is going to be the formatted date.

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:47.810
So now what we should see,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.020
if everything is working correctly, is that's normal.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.784
But when we go to a day that is filled out,

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:56.719
we get this UI right here.

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.659
So it looks great on IOS.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.469
Let's check it on Android.

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.229
And it also looks great on Android.
