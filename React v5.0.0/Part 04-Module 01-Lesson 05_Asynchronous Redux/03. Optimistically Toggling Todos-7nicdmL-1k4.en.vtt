00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
Now, just as we did with our removeItem method here,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.230
we also want to optimistically allow the user to toggle a todo item.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.500
So, what we'll do is, we'll keep this line here.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.425
So, we instantly dispatch toggleTodoAction.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:23.115
After that, the API method we want to invoke is going to be saveTodoToggle,

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:25.469
parsing it the id.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.875
And then, if there is an error,

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:34.064
we want to go ahead and call this.props.store.dispatch toggledTodoAction.

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:37.009
So we basically want to redo or undo

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:41.314
the toggle event that occurred parsing in the id again.

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:43.849
And then as always, let's just say,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.760
"An error occurred. Try again."

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:54.138
So now, what should happen if we refresh our app and we toggle a todo item?

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:57.755
Eventually, this request will fail.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:59.330
And when it does,

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.504
so there it goes, we get an error.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:07.780
When it does, it's going to revert back to its previous state, and there we go.
