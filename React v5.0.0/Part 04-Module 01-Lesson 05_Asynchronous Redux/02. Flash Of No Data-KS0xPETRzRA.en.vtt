00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
At this point, when we refresh our application, we get this UI.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.629
And then once all of our data loads,

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.129
that drops into play.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.125
This is a little bit weird because it kind of deceives the user.

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:14.129
It looks like we have no data until that data loads,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.275
and then it just gets rendered to the view.

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:20.009
So, what we want to do instead is as the data is loading,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.315
we want to show a little loading indicator.

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:23.640
And then once it's done loading,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.010
we get this full UI here.
