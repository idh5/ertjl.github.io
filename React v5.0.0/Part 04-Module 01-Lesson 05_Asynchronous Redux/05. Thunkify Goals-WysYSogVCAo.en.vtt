00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
Now that we have the ability to return functions from our action creators,

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.910
let's go ahead and thunkify our goals component.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.550
We will move all of this data fetching logic as well

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.734
as all of this data fetching logic to their own action creators.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.859
So what we'll do here, is eventually,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.969
we want to be able to call this.props.store.dispatch.

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:27.239
We'll make a brand new action creator.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.689
We'll call it handleAddGoal and what it is

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.079
going to take in and again this is the functionality we need to do,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.390
so we want to add the goal and then we want to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.987
reset the input value to be an empty string.

00:00:38.987 --> 00:00:40.216
So as the first argument,

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:45.637
we will pass in the goal itself which is just going to be this.input.value,

00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:47.369
and then as the second argument,

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.899
we want a way to reset the input value to an empty string.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.399
So what we can do is we can pass it a callback that will

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.019
just say this.input.value equals an empty string,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.055
that way we can still do the same functionality from inside

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:09.140
of handleAddGoal but in order to get access to resetting the input value,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.105
We will just invoke the second argument which is the callback function.

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:19.010
Now I'm going to copy all of this code and now let's head up to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.303
our action creators and create this handleAddGoal action creator.

00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:31.409
Right here, we will make a new function called handleAddGoal,

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.703
it's going to take in two things;

00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:38.064
the name of the goal as well as the callback function.

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:40.929
Because we have some asynchronous stuff going on we want

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.930
to return a function that's going to be passed, dispatch.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.040
Then now I'm going to paste in that logic that we saw earlier,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.915
so we'll call it API.saveGoal.

00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:53.420
Passing it, name.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.595
Once that resolves then what we want to do

00:01:57.594 --> 00:02:01.435
is call dispatch, dispatching the addGoalAction.

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:06.923
Passing in the goal we got back from the API and then instead of doing this.input.value,

00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:10.569
we can just invoke our callback function that's passed in here as

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.329
the second argument to our handleAddGoal action creator.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.080
That should work well.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.040
The next thing we need to do as far as our Goals component is concerned

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:26.250
is move all of this logic to its own action creator.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.419
We'll do something similar,

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.859
where we want to eventually create an action creator called,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.830
we'll call it handleDeleteGoal,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.778
and we will pass to it the goal and then I'm going to remove all of this and copy it,

00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:45.668
and then up at our action creators.

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:51.430
Let's now make that call handleDeleteGoal is going to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.189
take in the goal and again we want to return

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.240
a function here so we can get access to dispatch.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.090
Then now we'll paste in all the functionality from

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.125
below but instead of calling this.props.store,

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:11.054
we can just invoke dispatch and everything else looks pretty good.

00:03:11.054 --> 00:03:13.240
Now we can test this out.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.610
Let's hit "Refresh" and then inside of

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.968
our goals component we should be able to add a new goal.

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:25.729
That looks good and then we should also be able to remove a goal.
