00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So what we'll do, is let's make a new reducer which is

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.109
in charge of the loading state for our app.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.380
So, let's head up here to our Redux code.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.695
And right under our goals reducer,

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.530
let's have a brand new reducer that we will call loading.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.079
We will set the default state to true and then it will also receive an action.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.439
And then just as we always do with our reducers,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.265
we want to switch on action.type.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:36.030
And we already have an

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.405
action.type here that we want to listen for us to receive data action type.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.975
So we'll say, if the case is receive data,

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.929
then what we're going to do is just return false or update

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.515
the loading state of our store to false.

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:53.160
And then as default,

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.699
we always want to return just the initial state.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.970
So now, in order to add this brand new reducer to our store,

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.614
what we need to do, is pass it in here as a property to combine reducers.

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:08.988
So we will say, loading.

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:16.555
And then now, what this is going to allow us to do is inside of our app component,

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:19.690
we're no longer just receiving todos and goals,

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.795
but we should also be receiving, is loading.

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:24.640
So then, we can say,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.969
if loading equals true,

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.905
then go ahead and just render h3.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:35.695
And we will say loading, and then we'll close it.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:38.349
So now, what our UI will look like,

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:41.140
is as our app is loading, we just get the state.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.180
This is loading, but when it's finished loading,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.370
we now get our updated UI.
