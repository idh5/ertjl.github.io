00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
At this point, our app is working fine.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.199
We just updated it to work with asynchronous data coming from an external API.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.275
However, the way the code is organized right now,

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:14.609
we've mixed all of our data fetching logic with our component UI logic.

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.300
Right now, our component that should just be focused on how

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.214
the UI looks is also responsible for fetching data.

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:24.914
It would be nice if we could keep those separate.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:27.719
Instead of calling our API and then passing

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.674
that data to our action creator like we're doing now,

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:35.549
what if we move the data fetching logic from the component to our action creator?

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.354
By calling our API in an action creator,

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:40.529
we make the action creator responsible for

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.484
fetching the data it needs to create the actual action.

00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:45.884
Moving the data fetching code here,

00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:50.399
we'll build a cleaner separation between our UI logic and our data fetching logic.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.369
Let's see what this actually looks like.
