00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
The only other place where we are mixing our data fetching logic in with

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:07.125
our component UI logic is inside of

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:11.219
our main App component when we fetch our initial data.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.020
So, just as we've done in the past,

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.855
we want to move this up to it's own action creator.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.435
So, what we'll do is instead of having all this logic here,

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:28.719
let's make any other action creator that we will eventually call handleInitialData,

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:32.149
and then I'm going to copy all of this.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.825
And then up where our action creators are,

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:44.420
let's make a brand new one here that we will call handleInitialData.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.980
And at this point, you've seen it plenty of times we return

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.458
a function that gets passed dispatch,

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:57.290
and now we can move all of that logic into here.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.914
And instead of calling store dot dispatch,

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:03.479
we just simply call dispatch.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.909
And to check that this is still working,

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.950
let's head back over to our App.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.380
So, we get loading, and then after about two seconds,

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:12.119
we will get our initial data.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.905
So, now what we've done is we have successfully moved all of

00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:24.469
the data fetching logic from our components into our action creators.
