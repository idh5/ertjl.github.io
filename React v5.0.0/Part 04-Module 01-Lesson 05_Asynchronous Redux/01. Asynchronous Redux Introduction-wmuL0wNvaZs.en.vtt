00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
At this point, though basic,

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:04.214
our app is coming together nicely.

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:06.764
We can add and remove different todos and goals,

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:09.300
and that data is living inside of Redux.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.964
However, at this point,

00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:13.769
all of our data lives locally within the app itself.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.539
That isn't really realistic.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.269
In the real-world, that data would likely exist in

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.449
a database and you'd interact with it through an API.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.564
So that's what we're going to do in this lesson.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.205
We'll move all of our data to an external API,

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:30.189
then we'll see how Redux changes once our data becomes asynchronous.
