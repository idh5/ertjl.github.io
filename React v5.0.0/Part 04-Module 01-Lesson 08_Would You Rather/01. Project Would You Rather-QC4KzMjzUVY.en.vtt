00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
The app that you're going to be building is a variation on the Would You Rather game.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.179
The game itself provides the user with two choices,

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:10.394
and the user has to decide if they'd rather choose option A,

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:12.480
or rather choose option B.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.464
The game will keep track of the number of votes that each option gets,

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:18.734
and displays how your vote compares with all votes over time.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:23.062
As you can tell, there are a lot of little pieces of state changing throughout this app.

00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:25.410
You need to manage the list of questions,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.179
which option the user picked,

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.304
the total number of votes for each question, and more.

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:33.780
So, you'll need to put your reading skills into practice here.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.250
Check in the following sections for

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.320
the specific details on how the app needs to function.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
