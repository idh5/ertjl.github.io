00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
At this point, you should be fairly comfortable

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.009
dealing with local state inside of your components.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.830
However, one thing we haven't talked about yet,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.129
is how to fetch and manage data that is living in a database somewhere.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.720
Your first intuition might be to make an Ajax request inside of the render method.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.089
Unfortunately, that's a bad idea because

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.500
the render method needs to be free of side effects.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.190
It shouldn't make Ajax request,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.565
or do anything that is asynchronous in nature.

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:28.070
It should only receive props and return a description of the UI.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.170
So, if we can't make Ajax requests in the render method, where should we make them?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.314
This introduces the concept of life cycle events in React.

00:00:37.314 --> 00:00:40.878
Lifecycle events are special methods each component has,

00:00:40.878 --> 00:00:45.679
that allow us to run custom behavior during certain times of the component's life.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.460
Times like when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.649
when a component receives new props, and a few others.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.170
React has a bunch of different lifecycle events that you can hook into, but for now,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.885
we're only going to talk about the most common ones.

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:02.659
First, is componentDidMount.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.009
It's immediately invoked after the component is inserted into the DOM.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.800
Then, comes componentWillUnmount which is

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.890
invoked immediately before component is removed from the DOM.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.280
Last is getDerivedStateFromProps, which will

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.670
be invoked whenever the component is about to receive brand new props.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.930
Now, I realize this is a lot of information to remember.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.640
Don't get overwhelmed thinking you need to memorize all of them.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.310
Instead, try to remember that they exist,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.700
and then look up the documentation when you need them.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.665
Now, we still have to answer the initial question,

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:38.000
if we wanted to fetch external data from an API, how would we do this?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.480
This is the perfect use case for the componentDidMount lifecycle events.
