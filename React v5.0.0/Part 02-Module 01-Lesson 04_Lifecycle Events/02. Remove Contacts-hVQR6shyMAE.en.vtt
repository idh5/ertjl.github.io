00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.232
Another method that we have inside of our API file is this remove method right here.

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:09.765
What we want to do is whenever we remove a contact,

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:11.960
instead of just updating our local state,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.850
what we also want to do is update our API.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.204
All we need to do is,

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:21.535
when removeContact is invoked along with calling setState,

00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:23.714
we also want to invoke that remove method.

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:25.710
So what we'll do is,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.499
we have already imported everything from our ContactsAPI,

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:33.240
the only thing we need to do now is once we call setState,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.070
we can call ContactsAPI.remove and then just pass it.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.329
The contact is being passed to removeContact when it is invoked.
