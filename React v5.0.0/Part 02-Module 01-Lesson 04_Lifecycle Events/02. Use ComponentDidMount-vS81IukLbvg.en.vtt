00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
If you want to make an Ajax request in React,

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:05.970
use the componentDidMount lifecycle event.

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:08.244
Let's walk through how this works.

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:10.454
Once our component is added to the view,

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:12.644
componentDidMount will be invoked,

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:15.839
componentDidMount will initiate our Ajax request,

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.795
once the request has finished and we have the response,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.120
setState is called which updates the state of

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.230
our component with our newly requested data.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.370
This will tick off a re-render and update the UI.
