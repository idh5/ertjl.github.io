00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.104
As of right now, what we've done is we've hard coded

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:07.494
our array of contacts in the state of our app component.

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.449
Now, this has been great for learning purposes,

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.024
but it's not really realistic.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.410
Odds are these contacts would be living

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.050
inside of a database somewhere and in order to get them,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.955
you'd need to make an API request.

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:20.199
So, that's what we're going to do in this video.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.489
If you remember, one of the files that was given to you was the contacts API file.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.304
And one of the methods that we are exporting from this file is the getALL method,

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:33.840
which is going to make a fetch request

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.395
to our contacts API and it's going to return a promise.

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:39.179
And when that promise resolves,

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.140
we will have all of the contacts.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.005
So, what we will do, first,

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:47.460
is let's import everything from that module as

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.475
contacts API and it's going to come from utils/ContactsAPI,

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:59.695
and then now we're going to get rid of all of our default state here.

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:03.954
We'll add a lifecycle method called componentDidMount.

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:05.483
So, when this component mounts,

00:01:05.483 --> 00:01:10.709
what we want to do is we will call ContactsAPI.getAll,

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.219
that's going to return us a promise that when it resolves,

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.780
the function we passed out then we'll be passed the contacts.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.890
And then once we have the contacts in order to update our state,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.019
all we need to do as we've seen a few times now,

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:30.959
it's called this.setState, returning an object with the brand new contacts.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.103
So, now, when our app reloads,

00:01:33.103 --> 00:01:39.030
instead of all of these contacts living and originating from our local component state,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.563
what we're doing is we are fetching those contacts from a remote server,

00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:45.493
and then once we get back that response,

00:01:45.493 --> 00:01:48.819
we update our local state which then we'll update the UI.
