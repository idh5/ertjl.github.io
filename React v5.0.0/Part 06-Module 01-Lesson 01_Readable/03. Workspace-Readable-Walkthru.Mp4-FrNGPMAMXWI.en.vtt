00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Okay, so over here in the left,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.440
we have the file picker and it gives you a few options

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.310
and features to help manage the files in your project.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.195
So say for example if I want to open up the read me mark down,

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:13.900
I'll just double click on it and opens up right over here on the right side.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.565
If you want to add any of your own files,

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:18.210
let's say if you had any existing code or you want to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.410
upload individual folders or files into this project,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.670
just go over at the bottom, upload files in

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.650
history and pick your individual files or folders to add.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.260
So, just where you do it.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.080
At the very top, if you wanted to add new files or add new folders into this project,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.570
let's go ahead and click on these buttons.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.975
Here's the one for add file, and here's one for add folder.

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:43.415
Click on that, click folder name and create folder.

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:45.965
Great. So all the files open up

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:49.325
over here at the very top, you can go ahead and close them.

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:52.565
So over here at the bottom, we have the area for your terminals.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:54.295
So for this project in particular,

00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:57.990
keep in mind that we have two servers open for this project.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.785
So let's check back in the read me over here.

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:06.190
Open up that, and you can see here is that we have one for API server,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.890
and another terminal for our pre-scaffold Create React App project.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.905
So let's go ahead and open up these terminals.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.965
Click the plus sign, one for each.

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:17.940
So one thing to note is that for both of these two terminals,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.340
you're starting at home/workspace,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.770
but for the API server it lives in the API server folder.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.095
And for the project,

00:01:25.095 --> 00:01:27.175
it lives inside the frontend folder.

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:30.240
So let's say for example on the API server you would need to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.865
CD directly into that, so CD API-server.

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:36.930
The terminal.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.310
Make sure you go to the frontend folder,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.570
CD right into it. CD frontend, cool.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.155
And from there, go ahead and install and start your servers.

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:48.615
So let's go ahead and check out the preview tab on the bottom left.

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:51.780
So click on it, and obviously nothing's really happening right now.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.910
We don't actually have any servers open right now.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.430
So nothing should be running.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.745
You should be seeing this.

00:01:56.745 --> 00:02:00.510
But if you actually went ahead and let's say

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.135
for this project terminal over here, do NPM install.

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:11.715
Now let's go ahead install the API server.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:16.775
Great. Now we'll start the server,

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:22.405
and let's also make sure that we start the project.

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:25.175
Great. Now at this point,

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:27.410
if we hit the open preview tab,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.170
you should see everything up and running.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.235
Cool. Good to go.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.895
Now, once you're done with your project,

00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:35.245
go here at the very bottom,

00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:36.565
where you see submit project,

00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:40.090
and that's how you get to submit your project for your reviewers to review.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.785
One more thing to note, is this menu button over here.

00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:44.734
So let's say things are running kind of wonky,

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:45.948
need to refresh your workspace,

00:02:45.948 --> 00:02:47.560
but you also want to keep your data.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.990
In that case, you click on refresh workspace.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.970
But let's say if you want to restart everything,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.170
bring it back to the original state,

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.970
bring back all the starter code that you first began with,
63
00:02:56,970 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
you can actually do so by hitting reset data.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
