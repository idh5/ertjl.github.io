When we use JavaScript inside of the browser to render the UI,

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.094
sometimes people call this a single-page application.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:08.879
But what does this really mean?

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.980
A typical website works like this.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.870
When a user visits the website,

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.884
the browser requests a page from website server.

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:19.065
The server generates some HTML and sends it down.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:20.670
When the user navigates,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.130
the browser requests a new page from the server.

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.054
The server sends the new page's HTML to the browser,

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:28.109
and the user sees the new page.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.710
Every time the user navigates, the cycle repeats.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.554
When people say single-page application,

00:00:34.554 --> 00:00:37.109
they don't mean there is only one screen in the app.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.075
They mean the browser doesn't need to go back to the server for new pages.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:44.870
Instead, JavaScript can handle the transitions between pages.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:48.574
So, there's only a single initial page sent from the server.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:51.275
That's why it's called a single-page application.

00:00:51.274 --> 00:00:56.179
React Router is a tool that lets us use react to build single-page applications.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.820
So, let's use it to add some routes to our contacts app.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
