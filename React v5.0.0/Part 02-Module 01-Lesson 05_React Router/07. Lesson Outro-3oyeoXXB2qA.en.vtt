00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
Cool. Our app has a new screen and since we're using React Router,

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:06.359
all of our user's expectations are met.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.070
When they click on our new link,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.804
the router transitions the new screen and the URL updates.

00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:14.279
They can then click the back button to go back,

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.259
and the forward button to go forward.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.775
They can refresh the page,

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:19.948
right-click a link to open in a new tab,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.765
or share this URL with a friend.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:23.205
This is how the web works,

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:25.169
and we don't want to break it.
