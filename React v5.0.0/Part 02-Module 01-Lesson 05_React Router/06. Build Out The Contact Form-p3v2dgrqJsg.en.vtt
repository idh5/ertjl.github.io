00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
So, at this point, we are able to navigate to our slash create route,

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.870
but the component that we are rendering there,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.435
which is our CreateContact component,

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.700
isn't actually doing anything yet.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.179
So, let's go ahead and make it a little more interesting.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.100
So, what we want to do first,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.710
is let's go ahead and import Link,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.969
because the first thing we want to do is set up a back button.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.029
So, we will grab Link from react-router-dom,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.200
and then inside of our UI here, let's delete that,

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.200
and the first thing we want to render is a link,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.400
we'll give it a className of close-create-contact.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.630
I'm going to close our sidebar here just to give us a little bit more room.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.625
The next prop we want to pass it,

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:53.054
is where we want to actually go,

00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:56.159
which is just going to be our home route,

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.349
and then we will say close.

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:01.804
Then now if we save this,

00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:04.885
what we should have is a little error button here,

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:09.185
and now we can navigate between both of these different routes.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.460
So, now the next thing we want to do, is if you remember,

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.714
the whole point of create is to be able to create a new contact,

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:22.034
and part of that is having the user be able to upload their image.

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:25.829
So, we have this image input component,

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.734
that was given to you when you first started out.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:30.370
So, what we want to do now,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.380
is let's go ahead and render that.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:39.039
We'll give this a class name of create-contact-avatar,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.200
inputs a little long, but it'll work.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.010
We'll give it a name of avatar URL,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.120
and then let's say maxHeight is going to be 64,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.640
and let's not forget to wrap this inside of a form component

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.230
because that's the whole point of the slash create route,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.620
and we'll also give this form a class name,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.520
we will say it's going to be create-contact form.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.924
Then, now you'll notice we have our little ImageInput here,

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:17.810
and the next information that we want to get from the user is their name,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.295
and their twitter handle.

00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:21.619
So, right below our image input,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.534
let's render a div with a class name of create-contact-details,

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:29.984
and then inside of here,

00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:32.445
what we'll have is two different inputs.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:37.495
The first one, or really both of them will have a type of text,

00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:40.664
name will be name, and then placeholder,

00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:42.699
will be Name on this first one,

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.859
and the second one will also have a type of text.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.959
Name is going to be handle,

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.759
and place holder will just be Handle.

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:56.179
Now the last thing our form needs is a nice little button,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.194
which we can just come in and add right here,

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:04.180
and what it will say is Add Contact.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.010
So now, this looks pretty good.

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.479
What we need to do now and we'll do this in the next video,

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.189
is when we fill out this form,

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.669
we now need to take that information,

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.849
save it to our fake database,

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.949
or make an API request for that,

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.289
and then also update our local state.
