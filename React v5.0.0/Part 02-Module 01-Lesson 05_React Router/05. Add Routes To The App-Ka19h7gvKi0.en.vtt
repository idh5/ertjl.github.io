00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
So, this is the third and final thing that we need to do in our app to

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.679
get React router to start managing the URL and the UI for us.

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.949
So, come back to our App.js file here,

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.174
and import something called a route,

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.984
which is going to come from react-router-dom,

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:22.949
and we'll come down here to where we have this logic right here.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.609
Instead of doing that,

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.984
let's go ahead and actually render a route.

00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:33.170
We'll give it a path of slash and then we will give it a render prop.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.515
This render prop is going to take a function here.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:42.715
Now, let's move our List Contacts component into that render function.

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:47.090
So, now we have route path slash and here's what we

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.875
want this route to render when this path matches the URL.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:55.024
So, let's do the same thing for Create Contact.

00:00:55.024 --> 00:00:57.399
We'll have a route, we'll say path,

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.219
it's going to be slash create.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.560
We don't have to use render here,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.170
we could use something called component and what we can

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.200
pass it as the Create Contact component.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.620
So, this is just another option where we can say just render

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.760
this component for me when the path matches slash create.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.859
So, up here, we wanted to parse the List Contacts a few custom props.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.659
So, we use react routers or routes render prop here to say, "Hey,

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.359
we want to be the ones who are creating this element so

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.359
we can be the ones who pass it specific prompts."

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:35.814
But down here, since we weren't needing to pass the Create Contact component any props,

00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:37.875
we can just say, "Hey, here's the component.

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.614
Go ahead and render that yourself,

00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:41.280
go ahead and create that element yourself,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.439
react router, because we don't need to actually pass it anything."

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.750
So, right now, what I want you to do before I hit save,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.959
is I want you to think about what route,

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.229
or specifically what component is going to be rendered,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.329
List Contacts or Create Contact?

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.004
So, we are at the slash create path.

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.269
So, if I hit save, that's a little strange.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.534
What's happening is we are still getting both components.

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:10.639
We're getting our List Contacts component right here,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.954
and we're also getting our Create Contact component right here.

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:19.575
The reason for that is because technically, both paths match.

00:02:19.574 --> 00:02:22.108
Slash create matches fully,

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.335
but slash also matches partially.

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:26.670
So, in order to fix that,

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.439
what we can do is we can say,

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:37.974
"We only want to match and to render our List Contacts when slash matches exactly."

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:40.969
So, now if we save this what we'll see is we only

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.030
see the Create Contact component because

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.090
slash create no longer matches slash

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.775
because we're only matching exactly rather than just partially.

00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:52.515
So, we can actually test this out.

00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:56.744
We can just go to localhost 3,000 and when we do that,

00:02:56.745 --> 00:03:02.689
our List Contacts component is going to be rendered because the path matched exactly.

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.030
Now, when we click on this link component,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.330
you'll notice at the bottom left-hand corner we're going to go to slash create.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.450
When we do that, this component is no longer going to be

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.049
rendered because we are not at slash or we're not at the home screen.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.555
Instead, we are at slash create.

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:20.260
So, we then get the Create Contact component.

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:21.840
So, now what we can do,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.740
since react router is managing these screens for us,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.425
we can delete the screen property on our states.

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:30.064
Then we can also get rid of

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:35.930
our own navigate prop that we are passing down to our List Contacts component.
