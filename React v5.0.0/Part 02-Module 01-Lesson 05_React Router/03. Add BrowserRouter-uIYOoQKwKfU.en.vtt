00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Now that React router is installed,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.115
we can use all of the different components that it comes with.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:08.699
So, inside of our main index.css file here,

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:14.054
let's go ahead and import BrowserRouter from react-router-dom,

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:19.394
don't forget the dashed.com and don't forget the curly braces around BrowserRouter.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:24.059
Now, all we need to do is take our main app component,

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:28.125
and wrap it around our BrowserRouter.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:29.800
What this will allow us to do,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.760
is it will allow us to use

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.658
the other components that React router dom comes with inside of our app,

00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:38.013
and it'll also listen to the URL.

00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:40.585
So, whenever the URL changes,

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:43.024
the routing components will be notified of that.

00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:45.469
So, that's it for this file go ahead and save it,

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.810
and then we'll continue on in the next video.
