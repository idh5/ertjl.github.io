00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.774
The final component we need is called the route.

00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:06.224
Route takes a path that will match the URL, or not.

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:08.324
If the path matches the URL,

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:10.320
then the route will render some UI.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.960
But it won't render anything if it doesn't match.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.450
What is like the code that we had that was checking

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.829
our component's state to decide which screen we wanted to render,

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.779
route will do that same sort of thing.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.195
But instead of checking component's state,

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:24.859
it will check the URL.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.719
What does that mean? It means that the back button's still going to work.
