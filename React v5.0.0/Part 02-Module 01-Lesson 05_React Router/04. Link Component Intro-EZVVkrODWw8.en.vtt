The link component from React Router is critical.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.060
It's the way that the user navigates through your app.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:07.814
When the user clicks a link,

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:11.625
it talks to the BrowserRouter and tells it to update the URL.

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.335
It's also accessible.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:16.905
If you use the keyboard to navigate an app, it'll still work.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:19.920
Or maybe you want to right-click and open a new window.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.315
That's going to still work, too.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:24.830
These components do what users expect a link on the web to do.
