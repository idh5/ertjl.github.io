00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
So, what good is a contacts app if you can't create new context?

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.900
Let's add a new screen to this,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.509
which will allow us to add new people onto our list.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.945
So, the first thing we want to do is create a new file in our app.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.884
We'll call it CreateContact.js.

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:17.339
We need to, as always,

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.559
import React and component.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.835
Now, let's make our component class by saying CreateContact,

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:26.743
it's going to extends Component,

00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:30.449
and this will be a boring render method for now.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.219
Let's just have a div.

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.274
We'll say Create Contact,

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:38.829
and then we need to make sure that we export this as the default export.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.949
Then now what we can do inside of our app file,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.540
we can go ahead and import that.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.570
So we will import CreateContact from the module we just barely created.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.509
Let's go ahead and render it just to make sure that it works.

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:55.884
So down here, we can say CreateContact,

00:00:55.884 --> 00:00:58.434
and now you'll notice that we have it right here.

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:03.185
So, the idea here isn't just to show every different component inside of our app,

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:07.340
but instead to show different components based on the current URL.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.370
But before jumping straight to React router,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.775
let's go ahead and implement a few of these steps on our own.

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:16.295
So, we already know how to use component state,

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:19.040
so let's go ahead and use component state first in

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.750
order to decide which component we should render.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.290
So, what we will do is let's come up here to our state and we'll add a new property,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.925
let's call it screen.

00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:32.194
We'll have this default to create,

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:36.979
and then now what that's going to allow us to do is inside of our render method,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:44.480
what we can do is we can say if this.state.screen equals list,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.370
then go ahead and show

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.890
the ListContacts component and we'll do the same thing for CreateContacts.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.974
So, we will say if this.state.screen equals create,

00:01:56.974 --> 00:02:01.560
then go ahead and show the CreateContact component.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.030
So now, what we get is

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.390
our CreateContact component and we can

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.090
come over here and manually change this back to list,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.310
and what we will get is now our list component.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.050
So, let's go ahead and change this back to create,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.800
and then in the next video,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.330
we will take this a step further.
