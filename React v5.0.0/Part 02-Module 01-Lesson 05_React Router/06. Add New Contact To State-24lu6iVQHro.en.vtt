00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.379
So, at this point, we have our CreateContext component.

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.290
It's responsible for getting the form data specifically the name,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.449
the handle, and the avatar from the user.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:14.714
Then all it's going to do is it's going to call whatever this.props.onCreateContact is,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.984
passing it that form data or those values.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:21.210
So, what we need to do is we now need to make sure that we

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.914
pass create contact and onCreateContact prop.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:27.839
Now inside of onCreateContact,

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.589
we need to make sure that we create our contact with

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.625
the API and we also want to update our local state.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:37.609
So, what we'll do is head over to our app.js file.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.634
I'm going to give us a little bit more room here.

00:00:39.634 --> 00:00:43.159
Then now, what we're going to do is let's create a new method here

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:49.559
called CreateContact and if you remember on our API,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.454
the last method that we have that we haven't used yet is going to be the create method.

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:59.780
What we need to pass it is the actual new contact.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.560
So, we'll assume once create contact is invoked we're going to be past that.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.490
So, we will pass the contact that is then going to

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:12.560
return us a promise and when that promise resolves,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.295
we will be passed a new format of contact.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:19.385
What we can do is when we get that contact back,

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:25.230
we want to call setStates and add it to our contacts array.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.469
So, what we can do is if we are

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.780
updating the new state based on the previous state which is what we're doing here,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.859
we will be passed the previous state.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.159
I think earlier we called it the current state which works too.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.700
We can say currentState.contacts.concat.

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.039
What do we want to concatenate on to our current state?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.419
Well we want to concatenate on a brand new contact.

00:01:50.418 --> 00:01:53.000
So, now this method is all done.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.719
But what we need to do is we need to pass it as a prop to our CreateContact component.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.810
But how would we do that if React router is in charge of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.409
rendering the component because that's what we're passing as a prop to component?

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.400
Well, what we can do just as we did up here is instead of using component,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.055
we can use render.

00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:19.015
That will put us in charge of creating the actual element.

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:24.604
So, what we could do now is we want to render CreateContact just as we were doing before.

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:28.250
But now what we want to do is we want to say

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.275
the onCreateContact prop is going to be a function.

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:37.280
When this function is invoked what we want to do is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.905
call this.CreateContact that we just barely created right here.

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.949
We also want to pass it the contact that we are

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.054
getting when onCreateContact prop is invoked.

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:54.860
So, now why did I create a brand new arrow function here instead of

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.925
just passing CreateContact directly to onCreateContact as we've seen before.

00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:03.430
Well, the reason for that is because once we submit our form,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.075
what we want to do is we want to navigate back to the home screen with React router.

00:03:09.074 --> 00:03:14.149
One of the props that React router is going to give you is called history.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.670
On that history prop is a method called.push.

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.584
What that looks like is this.

00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:22.950
So, what's going to happen?

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.794
Let's walk through the whole flow here,

00:03:24.794 --> 00:03:28.814
is when onCreateContact is invoked,

00:03:28.814 --> 00:03:32.194
which it will be once we add a new contact.

00:03:32.194 --> 00:03:35.859
Then we're going to call this.CreateContact passing it

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.215
the contact that will go and invoke this function up here running all of this logic.

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:45.280
Then what's going to happen is we're going to call

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.610
history.push which is going to redirect us or

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.480
route us to the home route which will then give us the less contacts UI.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.674
So, let's go ahead and see if this is all working now.

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:00.640
So, we enter in a new name.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.734
We enter in a handle we enter in a brand new avatar.

00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:08.445
Then now when we add a new contact,

00:04:08.444 --> 00:04:12.370
we get an error and it is the exact same error I got in a previous video.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.515
It's the only error I've gotten this whole course.

00:04:14.514 --> 00:04:18.750
So, up here instead of currentState.contact,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.069
can't believe I did this again,

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:25.235
it's going to be.Contacts plural because again that's what we have up here.

00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:27.305
So, now let's try this out.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:29.935
Let's delete Tyler.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:32.564
Now, let's go and add me back in.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:36.634
So we will say Tyler McGinnis you can obviously say whatever you want.

00:04:36.634 --> 00:04:40.039
We're going to add a new avatar and then once we click add

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.365
contacts notice we get the brand new contact in our list of contacts.

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:48.340
But we are also redirected back to the Home view.
