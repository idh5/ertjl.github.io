Now, before we can use React router in our application,

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:08.070
we need to actually go ahead and install it from the MPM registry.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.425
So, what we can do is go and run Yarn add React-router-dom.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.655
Now, don't forget the dom with React router it can run in a few different environments.

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:19.380
For example, React router native,

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.509
but because we are dealing with the dom,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.740
because we're dealing with the web,

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.070
we need to run Yarn add React-router-dom.
