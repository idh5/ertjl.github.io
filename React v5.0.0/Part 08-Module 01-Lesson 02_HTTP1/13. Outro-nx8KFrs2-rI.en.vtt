00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.385
So how do you feel? HTTP is real in it,

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:04.388
but it is the foundation of the Web as we know it,

00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:06.600
and the knowledge you just gained is invaluable and

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.435
will help you understand why things behave the way they do.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.250
Before we dive into HTTP/2 though,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.915
we should talk about encryption in HTTPS.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:15.870
It is a highly misunderstood topic and has a reputation

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.170
of being only for enterprise organizations and e-commerce sites.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.430
That is definitely not correct.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.320
So grab a drink. It's much simpler than it sounds.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
