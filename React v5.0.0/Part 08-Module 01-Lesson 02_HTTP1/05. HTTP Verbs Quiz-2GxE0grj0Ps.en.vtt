00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
Okay. Let's go through this case-by-case.

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:04.070
For this first one,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.980
the client wants to check when logo.png was last modified.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.860
We know that the last modified header has that information.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.130
Since the client is not interested in actual content of the file,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.365
a header request is appropriate here.

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:20.880
Forms only allow two methods: GET and POST.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.670
Since we are sending data,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.020
we need to use POST as the method here.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.861
Whenever you want to retrieve the contents of the file,

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.465
you need to use GET.

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:33.885
All of the verbs use the response body for something else or not at all.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:36.465
Finding out which verbs are supported on an endpoint

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.360
is exactly what OPTIONS method is designed for.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.425
So that is the correct answer here.

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:45.985
Again, we are retrieving content here so the only method that makes sense is GET.

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:49.395
As you can see, there are many different ways to send a request.

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:51.111
For the server to respond correctly,

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:54.000
it's important that we're using the right verb for the job.
