00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
As developers, both you and I use HTTP everyday.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.290
We issue get and post requests when using Firebase that shows SDK

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.340
or just when using the browsers on our tablets or mobile phones to look at websites.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.040
To be a good fraudulent engineer creating web apps,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.065
merely using HTTP is not enough.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.110
You will need a deeper understanding to see why certain techniques are

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.135
being used and why others either don't work or aren't recommended.

00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:26.695
In this lesson, we'll start with a look at the first version of HTTP.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:28.770
We'll examine the get and the post methods,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.280
and a few other useful methods you might not be as familiar with.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.480
We'll look at a variety of headers and how API's are designed to work well with the web.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.855
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:40.620
you'll be able to debug HTTP request response pairs on

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.000
the wire and will understand what a RESTful API is.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
