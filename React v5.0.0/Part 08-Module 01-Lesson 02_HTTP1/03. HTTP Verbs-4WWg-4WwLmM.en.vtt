00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
Take a look at this. This one is an image of a flamingo.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.945
This one is a request to get this image.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.415
Do you notice anything different between them, though?

00:00:09.415 --> 00:00:12.290
HTTP has been around for such a long time that

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.225
the protocol still does something that you'll rarely find in any modern protocol.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:19.260
It's regular text and can be read by a human.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.125
The bytes being pushed back and forth on the network are plain,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.495
old, regular text and can be read by our human brains.

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:29.040
HTTP's simplicity also means that we can directly interact with

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.460
a protocol without a third party library doing any extra work for us.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.030
Every HTTP request begins with a unique verb

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.300
called a method and serves a specific purpose.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.380
We already know GET and POST.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.980
And although these are the most common methods,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.920
there are other methods you will encounter regularly.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.335
The common set of methods consist of GET,

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:53.310
POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.000
We will talk more about these methods when we talk about REST APIs.
