00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.155
Every time the browser connects to a server to make a request,

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:07.560
it has to go through the TCP handshake process.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.230
This three-way handshake is very time consuming.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.930
To counteract the cost of these handshakes,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.325
HTTP/1.1 introduced the concept of Keep-Alive.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:20.075
If the client sets the connection Keep-Alive header,

00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:24.840
the server will not close the connection after successfully delivering the response,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.820
but allows the client to reuse

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.525
the already established connection for additional requests.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:33.570
Keep in mind though, that you still can send requests

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.745
before the response for the last request has been fully transferred.

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:40.440
All in all, this forces web developers to keep

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.620
the number of additional resources as low as possible,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
making the best possible use of their six connections.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.670
This is why JavaScript and CSS files are commonly concatenated

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.590
into bundles and why images are put together into sprites.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.170
The bundles can be obtained in just one request.
