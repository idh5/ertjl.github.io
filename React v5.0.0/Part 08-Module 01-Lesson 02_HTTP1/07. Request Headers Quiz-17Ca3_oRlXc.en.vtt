Here's the netcat command I use to connect to the server.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:05.450
Running it doesn't produce any errors,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.515
so I've connected successfully.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.085
The request we need to make needs a couple of things.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:13.440
they used Udacity verb.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.880
It has to include the host header since it's required in HDTV one.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.740
We need this header and it can't be empty.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.075
And the last header is date.

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:25.355
And this is the correct code.

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:29.255
As web developers, we don't often directly interact with sending

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:34.380
HTTP requests but it's important to know how they work and how they affect our apps.
