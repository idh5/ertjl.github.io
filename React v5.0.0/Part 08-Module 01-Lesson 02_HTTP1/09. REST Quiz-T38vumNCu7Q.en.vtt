00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
We want to create a new whale,

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.955
meaning we want to add something to a collection.

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:07.375
This tells us we want to use the post method.

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:09.870
So A goes into this first slot.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.100
The website has a list of animals which tells us

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.100
that the collection we're working on is called animals.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.710
So, D goes into the second slot.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.010
Now, the new item in that collection is supposed to be a whale,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.870
so adding a slash and whale to the path does the trick.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.790
So, the last two slots are filled with F and G.
