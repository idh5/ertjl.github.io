00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Thanks for coming back.

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.330
So we have a couple of cakes already.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.079
But you know, can you ever have too many cakes?

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:08.535
That was a rhetorical question, the answer is obviously no.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.394
So in light of this delicious fact,

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:12.009
let's make another cake.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.029
But we've learned from lesson one that if I make the cake,

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.605
it'll be downright ugly.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:18.629
If I let a professional make it,

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.320
then it'll look amazing, but there'll be no love or personality in it.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.300
This next cake needs the love and care from

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.460
the first cake and the quality of the second cake.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.650
Oh, well, hi Miriam.

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:32.201
Hi there.

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.945
Can you tell us a little bit about what you do here in Udacity.

00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:37.079
Yeah, I work on our mentorship programs to help

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.509
support student learning and improve their experience.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:40.854
That's really amazing, Miriam.

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:42.459
You do so much for the student community,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.905
and I know they really appreciate it.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:46.679
But I also know that you have some other hobbies as well.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.323
Yeah, let's see, among other things I bake a lot for the office.

00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:51.960
And it's awesome. I mean, really,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.390
everything she makes disappears instantly.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.980
Thank you so much.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.479
So, I was wondering,

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:58.949
my mom's birthday is coming up.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.800
Would you mind making a cake for her?

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.299
Oh my gosh. I would be honored.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.075
That's awesome. Thanks so much, Miriam.

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:05.260
She will love it.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.855
I hope so. I'll go get baking.

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:11.460
Asking Miriam to bake a cake for me is just like

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.269
the new technology we'll be looking at in this lesson.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:15.548
I'm not doing the work,

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.100
I just make the request,

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:19.454
and I don't have to load some professional library like

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:22.829
jQuery because this new tool is provided right in the browser.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.125
So, what is this life-changing tech?

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:27.219
Drum roll please.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.650
I give you the Fetch API.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.034
So, yeah, the name isn't all that impressive-sounding,

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:35.660
but Fetch really is an amazing tool that will change how you

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.609
write asynchronous requests. Let's see how it works.
