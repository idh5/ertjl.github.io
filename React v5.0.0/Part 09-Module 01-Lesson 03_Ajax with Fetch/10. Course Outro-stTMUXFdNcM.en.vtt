Thanks for joining me as we progress through the different ways to make AJAX requests.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.879
You now have three tools up your sleeve whenever you need to make async requests.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.515
You can make requests using the tried and true but somewhat cumbersome xhr way,

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:18.570
you use the jQuery library to smooth out making async requests using its API,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.504
and then you use the Fetch API to make promise-based asynchronous requests.

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:27.809
Using these tools, you can now make dynamic requests from your Javascript

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.465
that don't force Apache refresh and provide an overall better experience for your users.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.810
Now, before you go start making async requests in all of your apps,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.330
would it be bad if we had a little taste test?最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
