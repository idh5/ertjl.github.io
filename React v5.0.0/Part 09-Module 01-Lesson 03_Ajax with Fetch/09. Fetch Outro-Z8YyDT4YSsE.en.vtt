We just looked at making requests using the fetch API.

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:05.219
Fetch is awesome because...

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:09.239
It's done. Wow! Myrin that looks amazing. Thank you so much!

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.990
No problem. I hope your mom likes it.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.189
I'm sure she will,

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.549
thanks. But if she doesn't?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.675
More for me.

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:20.380
So, let's talk about asynchronous requests.

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:23.160
The new fetch API is awesome in so many ways.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.039
You can make a complicated request involving custom headers and

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.149
caching or a simple request using just the URL to the resource.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.134
There are also new headers, requests and response interfaces.

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:34.625
On top of this,

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:35.914
but just promise base,

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:39.835
so it naturally helps you create easy to write asynchronous calls in your code.

00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:43.375
In the past, making asynchronous calls has been somewhat tedious,

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.554
but thankfully with the new fetch API,

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:47.369
things have gotten a whole lot easier.
