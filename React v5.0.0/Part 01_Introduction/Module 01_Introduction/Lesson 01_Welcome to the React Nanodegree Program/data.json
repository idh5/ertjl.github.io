You will be learning as a part of a community of like-minded individuals, who will be challenging and supporting you every step of the way as you work toward a common goal. Make sure to visit your Study Group right here in the classroom for project help, networking, and collaboration with your classmates throughout your program!\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nLet's talk briefly about what the road ahead looks like. The program is made up of three main courses and some elective courses. At the end of each main course, you'll build and submit a project. To help you manage your time in each course, gauge your progress, and make sure you get the most out of the program, each project has a deadline. Now, deadlines can sound scary, but they’re not. They are an effective tool to help you finish the program and achieve your career goals. You just need to keep them in the back of your mind as you progress through the course and build in some buffer time for project planning, debugging, and other things that may come up. Building in extra buffer time will help you be less stressed out and remain on track.\n\nIf you're learning React for the first time, if you've worked with React before and want to dig deeper, or somewhere in between, we're glad to have you. Welcome to the program!",

After learning a certain concept and before going to the next lecture, try summarizing the concept in your head. Imagine that you’re trying to explain it to someone...or better yet go and actually explain it to someone! You can do this in person, on a video call with a friend, or you can share your insights with your fellow learners right in the classroom!\n\nTry out these strategies to improve your understanding and your retention of newly learned material:\n\n1. Ask yourself follow-up questions about the material. Here's an example: \"If I changed X in the example, would the code still work? How would it change?\"\n\n* Connect the new information to something you already know. In which ways are the two similar? How are they different?\n\n* Draw out the information in a visual form. Share your diagrams, visual models, or flowcharts.\n\n\nThese strategies will help you gain a deeper understanding of the material, help your classmates learn the material, and have a lot of fun while learning!\n",
