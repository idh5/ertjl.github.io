00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
In a standard Redux app,

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:05.144
when store.dispatch is called the reducer runs.

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:07.049
With our checkAndDispatch function,

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.439
we need to run some verification code before the reducer run.

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.509
So we run checkAndDispatch first,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.744
and then if the verification passes,

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:17.429
it runs store.dispatch which calls the reducer.

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.045
For this change, we had to manually alter our app code works.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:24.360
Wouldn't it be nice if we could leave our store.dispatch calls where they

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.169
were and run some code between store.dispatch and the reducer?

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.370
Well, it turns out,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.439
it does, it's called Middleware.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.359
Let's take a look at how we can replace

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.950
our checkAndDispatch function with native Redux Middleware.
