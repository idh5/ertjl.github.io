00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
So I have this issue,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.894
I keep wanting to invest in Bitcoin,

00:00:03.894 --> 00:00:08.594
but my financial adviser keeps insisting that that is a bad idea.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:11.970
In fact it's so bad that she wants us to add a new feature

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.660
to our app that whenever we add a new todo item or a new goal,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.054
if that goal or todo item contains the word Bitcoin,

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:22.214
then instead of adding it to the individual list,

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:27.015
what she wants us to do is just alert that that is a bad idea.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:29.785
So in order to do that, what we'll do,

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:35.554
we kind of want to hook into the moment after an action is dispatched,

00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:39.274
but before it ever hits our reducer and modifies the state.

00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:42.049
So what if we came in here?

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:44.629
So right above one we create our store.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.179
Let's create a new function here,

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.909
we will call it checkAndDispatch.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.779
So what we're going to do is we're kind of going to hijack

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.880
the actual dispatch function that we've been using and instead use checkAndDispatch.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.080
So checkAndDispatch will take in the store as well as

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.620
the action and then it's going to check

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.594
the name property on the action contains the word Bitcoin.

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:10.590
If it doesn't, then it's just going to call

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.799
store.dispatch as it normally would passing in the action,

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.879
and if it does, then we want to alert that warning and not do anything.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:23.039
So what we'll do here, is let's have an if statement here,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.565
and we will say if action.type equals ADD_TODO

00:01:29.564 --> 00:01:38.233
and action.todo.name.toLowercase

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:42.640
that includes the word Bitcoin,

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.625
then what we want to do is just return alert and we will say, "Nope.

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:53.500
That's a bad idea." So what we're doing here is obviously if the action type is ADD_TODO,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.359
and the new todo item which is going to be todo.name,

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.144
we lowercase that and if that includes the word Bitcoin,

00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:02.454
then we want to say, "Nope.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.959
That's a bad idea." And then we also want to do

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.604
a similar thing but instead of four ADD_TODO,

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:13.209
we will do ADD_GOAL instead of action.todo.name,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.366
we want to do action.goal.name.

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:22.618
And so if none of these two cases return an alert,

00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:24.442
then what we want to do,

00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:29.680
that means that the new todo item or the new goal does not contain the word Bitcoin,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.155
so we just want to call store.dispatch passing in the action as we normally would.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.780
So now we have our checkAndDispatch function,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.180
let's go ahead and use this instead of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.245
the regular dispatch so that we can have these checks in place.

00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:49.090
So it will do is anytime that we are calling store.dispatch,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:58.110
we want to replace that instead with calling checkAndDispatch invoking it,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.050
passing in the store as the first argument and then

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.320
passing in the action as the second argument.

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.364
So now if we look at our app,

00:03:10.365 --> 00:03:14.805
you'll notice here that we can still add normal items like walk the dog,

00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:20.430
but if we try to add anything that contains the word Bitcoin,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.385
what's going to happen as we get nope that's a bad idea?

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:26.469
And that item is not added to our list.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
