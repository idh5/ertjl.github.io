00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.995
For this exercise, you'll set up a proxy on your system,

00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:05.935
load a web website through the proxy,

00:00:05.935 --> 00:00:07.625
and examine the result.

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:10.420
A proxy is a legitimate man in the middle and has

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.185
many benefits like saving bandwidth by adding additional compression,

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:17.500
downsampling images, and doing aggressive caching.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.450
The proxy you'll be using is just going to well that's what you need to figure out.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.635
For this quiz, pick a non HTTPS website to test out.

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:31.135
You'll get a chance to try out an HTTPS site in the next quiz.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:33.105
Does the text of the website disappear,

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:36.180
are the site's images flipped upside down?

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.205
Do the colors of the site get inverted?

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.770
Is the site unreachable?

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.815
Or does nothing visibly change and the site looks completely normal?

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:46.985
Remember that you should run this in an incognito window to prevent caching.

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:50.515
Don't forget that you'll need to run the proxy on your own machine.

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:52.330
You'll find the binary for the proxy below,
