00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
So we have a look at encryption but remember that TLS

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.420
is made up of two parts, encryption and hashing.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.820
Hashing is the process of transforming data

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.185
into a short representation of the original data.

00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:16.920
The smallest change in the original data will have enormous changes in the hash.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.778
If two documents yield the same hash value,

00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:23.515
they are very very likely to be the same documents.

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:26.855
There are a couple of things we care about with hashing functions.

00:00:26.855 --> 00:00:30.615
One, it should be impossible to revert the conversion process,

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:33.930
meaning once data has been converted into a hash,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.740
it can't be unconverted back into the original data.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.860
And two, it should be just as impossible to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.840
find a different document yielding an identical hash value.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.605
One of the most common hashing functions is SHA which exists in multiple flavors like SHA

00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:56.475
256 or SHA 512 where the number says how big the output of the hash is in bits.

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:59.805
No matter how big the document is that you pass in,

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:05.720
you will always get 256 bits as output when you're using SHA 256.
