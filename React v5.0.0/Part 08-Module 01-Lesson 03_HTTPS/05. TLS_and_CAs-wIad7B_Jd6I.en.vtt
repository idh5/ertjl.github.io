00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.445
When we talk about HTTPS,

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:04.970
we are actually talking about two different concepts.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.370
HTTP and TLS, formerly known as SSL.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.405
We already know about HTTP,

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:14.245
and TLS stands for Transport Layer Security.

00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:15.915
TLS is not specific to HTTP,

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.610
but any protocol can use it.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.275
For example, there is FTPS,

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:21.616
which is FTP with TLS,

00:00:21.616 --> 00:00:23.430
to transfer files securely.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.670
TLS encrypts communication in a way that can't be

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.290
read by anyone else other than the intended recipients.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.005
In practice, it is impossible to break a TLS encryption.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.530
To ensure that you're talking to the server you intend to talk to,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.555
TLS utilizes something called,

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:40.905
a chain of trust.

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:43.980
A server identifies itself with a certificate that contains

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.880
both a little metadata about itself and the fingerprint of its encryption key.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.065
These certificates are issued by one of a handful certificate authorities.

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:05.795
If that certificate is signed by such an authority,

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:09.320
you know that if the key you're using matches that fingerprint,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.192
then you're talking to the correct server.

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:16.680
The list of certificate authorities can actually be found in the browser.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.860
You could even add your very own authority if you wanted to.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.880
What you see here are mostly companies that you can buy certificates from.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.835
They cost money as they not only validate your server,

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:30.930
but also validate your identity as the owner of that server.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.080
Since not every developer can or wants to pay money for

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.212
a certificate to offer basic security to the users,

00:01:37.212 --> 00:01:41.175
"Let's Encrypt" has come into the market and offer certificates for free.

00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:46.050
Let's take a closer look at how certificates work and the security they provide.
