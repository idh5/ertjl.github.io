00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
In the previous scenario,

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:04.285
only two things could have gone wrong.

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:09.075
Either their certificate authority signature on the certificate turns out to be invalid,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:13.915
or the server wasn't able to communicate after switching to symmetric encryption.

00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:16.940
In reality, there's a whole lot more that can go wrong.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.300
Certificates have an expiration date so they can go bad.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.300
They prescribe the set of hash and symmetric encryption functions they support,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.390
some of which have been proved to be weak over the years.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.320
Sometimes the certificate is valid,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.635
but the rest of the server setup is not.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:34.470
A great site to see how the browser behaves when

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.465
the TLS connection has some issues is badssl.com.

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:41.265
Badssl has its own valid certificate,

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:44.280
but it also has intentionally invalid certificates and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.470
invalid setups so we can see what the browser does in different situations.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.890
Let's check out Sha1-2016.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.340
Oh no, we've lost our green lock.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.850
Clicking this icon, gives us more information about the connection.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.930
Clicking this link, gives us specific details about the certificate being used.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.070
For this quiz, I want you to use the badssl website to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.245
figure out which setups cause Chrome to deny access to the website.

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:11.610
Will it happen with an expired certificate?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.190
What about a certificate from another host?

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.120
Does mixed content cause Chrome to deny access to the site? What about a-
