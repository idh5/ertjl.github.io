00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.830
TLS has two important cryptographic building blocks, encryption and hashing.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.425
When people think about encryption,

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.930
they probably think about symmetric encryption.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.265
You encrypt some data and give the encrypted data to someone else.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:17.880
The recipient needs the same key to decrypt the data he

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.660
got or otherwise it will be inaccessible to him.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.300
With a few mathematical tricks,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.090
the browser can utilize encryption algorithms that

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.465
use one key for encryption and another one for decryption.

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:34.020
Mostly the keys are encrypting messages is made public so that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.370
anyone that wants to send a message can just go ahead and encrypt with that key.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.435
They or anybody else won't be able to decrypt the message with the same key.

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:47.325
Only you, who has the decryption key will be able to decrypt it.

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:50.310
Due to the math that is going on under the hood.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.005
Both keys can actually be used for encryption and decryption.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:58.110
What one key encrypts can only be decrypted by the other.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.520
That's why it makes more sense to talk about a public key that is available to anyone and

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.590
a private key that is only available to the owner and should be stored securely.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.000
That's why asymmetric encryption is also called public key encryption.
