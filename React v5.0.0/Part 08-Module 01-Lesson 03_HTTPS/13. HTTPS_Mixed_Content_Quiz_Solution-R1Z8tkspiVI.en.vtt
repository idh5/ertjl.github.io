00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.905
So while the page itself is loaded over HTTPS,

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:09.650
there's a tile that's being loaded over http which causes a mixed content warning.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.880
There are actually a couple of ways to solve this problem.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.250
The easiest way is to check the console.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.520
The tile in question is x10y3.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.010
Another way is to check out the security pane.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.785
Down here is the mixed content warning.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:30.735
This link switches us to the network pane and adds the mixed content filter.

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:35.595
Using dev tools, it's incredibly easy to diagnose mixed content issues.

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.660
If you're developing anything on the web,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.900
you should always have the dev tools open.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.180
Trust me, they'll save you so much time.
