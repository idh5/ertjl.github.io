00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.350
When working locally, developers often

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.210
resort to using self-signed certificates.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.969
These certificates refer to themselves

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.590
as their own certificate authority, since

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.750
they are self signed, they don't provide

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640
any kind of authentication. Your browser

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.800
will visibly complain and give you a red

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.890
padlock, but it will let you test if your

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.720
website has mixed content, so you need to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.490
launch the binary for this project, and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.830
load the URL it provides in your browser.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.929
You might notice that when you launch

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.809
this server, it automatically generates a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.790
self-signed certificate for you, since

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.040
this is a self-signed certificate, you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.079
might see an error page. It's safe to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.399
proceed, so click on Advance and then

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.950
click on the perceived link down at the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.930
bottom. You'll see the Udacity logo has

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.030
been split up into multiple tiles. Are

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.489
there any mixed content violations and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.530
if so, which tile is causing the problem?

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.530
Enter the tile info here.
