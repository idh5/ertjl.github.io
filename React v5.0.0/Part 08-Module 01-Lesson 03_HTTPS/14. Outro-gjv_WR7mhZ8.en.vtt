Security is an important but sometimes intimidating aspect of web development.

00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:06.990
If you didn't know what HTTPS was before this lesson,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.450
you should feel much more comfortable with it now.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.410
Most hosting services and CDN's have support for TLS nowadays and with

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.310
more and more browser API's being enabled for HTTP web sites only,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.365
you should always use HTTPS for your users and your own sake.

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:23.070
In the next lesson, we'll take a look at

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.000
