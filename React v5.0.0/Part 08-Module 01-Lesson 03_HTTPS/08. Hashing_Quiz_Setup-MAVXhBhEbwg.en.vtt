00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
You just saw Surma playing with this cool little hashing project.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.300
For this quiz, you're going to use the same project to get

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.735
some hands-on experience with different hashing functions.

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:13.245
After launching the provided server and loading the URL it provides,

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:14.775
you should see the project.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:19.080
Then, type out some text to see what the different hashing functions produce.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.240
When you've typed out your text,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.850
enter the hashes in the provided text boxes.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
For example, paste the result from the SHA256 hashing function here.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.980
Once you've entered the hash for each one of these functions,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.140
alter the text a little and paste the new SHA256 hash here.
