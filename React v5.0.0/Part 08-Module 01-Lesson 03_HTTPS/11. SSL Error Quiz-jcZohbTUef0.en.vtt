Each link's background color kind of indicates what will happen.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.510
Red means it won't work. Green means it will.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.975
And other colors like orange give questionable results.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:15.225
A certificate that has expired or one for wrong host, both deny access.

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:19.860
Mixed content, incomplete chain,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.250
and sha256 all allowed the user through.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.335
But not all of these actually give you the green lock.

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:29.120
So, these are the correct answers. Great job.
