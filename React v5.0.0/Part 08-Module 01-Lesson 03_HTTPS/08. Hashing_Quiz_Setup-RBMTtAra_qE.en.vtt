00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
With this text the SHA1 hashing function gave me this.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.430
SHA256 resulted in this.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.030
And here's what SHA512 produced.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.400
Each one of these hashing functions started with the same text.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.435
But the hashes that were produced are completely different.

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:20.015
Let's say that my message is not all that exciting,

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:22.550
so I should only be cheering with one arm in the air.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.555
Removing just one character produced entirely different hashes.

00:00:26.555 --> 00:00:30.440
As you can see if anyone tries to tamper with even one character,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.870
they'll end up changing the entire hash.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.240
So it's easy for browsers and servers to see

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.030
this difference and know that the data has been altered.
