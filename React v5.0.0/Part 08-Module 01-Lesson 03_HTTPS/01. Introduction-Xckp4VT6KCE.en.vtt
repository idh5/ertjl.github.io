00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Have you ever thought about how naive it is to just use

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.910
the free Wi-Fi at cafes and similar public places?

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.510
You are trusting the store owner to not do anything dodgy and you're trusting

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.620
that every other person currently using the Wi-Fi hotspot is a good person.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.880
Not only can they listen to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.585
your traffic, you are broadcasting over radio waves after all,

00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:20.970
but they could also tamper with the data you receive.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.275
This is a harmless change.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:26.714
But what if you wanted to check your bank account on a public Wi-Fi?

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.595
Think about every other person being able to read or change your data.

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:32.595
We definitely don't want that.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:37.650
HTTPS is a way to protect you and your users from malicious cafe owners and visitors.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.575
As a web developer, HTPPS is even more important since

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:45.945
all modern browsers' APIs are only available if your website is secured with HTTPS.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.940
To exploit the full potential of the Web,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.007
you need to start using HTTPS,

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:51.350
and not just for the log-in page,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.070
but every single page.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250
Knowing a web page is using HTTPS,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.205
will give your users peace of mind in these kind of public places.

00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:01.770
How can you tell if a website is using HTTPS and how can you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.405
tell if a website is using HTTPS correctly,

00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:07.260
and how can you use HTTPS on your own website?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.000
That's what this lesson is about.
