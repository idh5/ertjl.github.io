If our index document is served over HTTPS, great.

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:05.855
But what about the site's assets,

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:08.270
are they surfed over HTTPS as well?

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.830
A fast way to break that beautiful green lock

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.790
is having your assets surfed over a regular HTTP.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.045
When this happens, the site ends up in a state called Mixed Content.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:21.270
Mixed content occurs when you open a website that is supposed to be

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.925
delivered over HTTPS but includes resources like images,

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:29.480
Iframe, stylesheets or scripts from non TLS secured origins.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.840
A popular mistake is pulling in jQuery from a non TLS enabled CDN.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.955
Depending on the type of resources that is being included over a nonsecure channel,

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.800
the consequences might differ.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.120
It might cost you a green padlock but still remain functional.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.655
The resource might get block or break your page

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:50.130
or it might even get the horrible red padlock of shame.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.730
The behavior differs across different browsers so it should

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.970
definitely avoid and check a website for mixed content.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.475
In fact, Google recommends that you'd surf all your assets over HTTPS.

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:02.870
This way, you'll avoid mixed content mornings and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.000
your site and its assets will be transferred securely.
