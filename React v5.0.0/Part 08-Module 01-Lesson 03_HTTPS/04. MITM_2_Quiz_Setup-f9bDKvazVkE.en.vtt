I still have the proxy set up and Chrome is writing through it.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.570
Let's load this secure website.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.545
And it doesn't work.

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:12.000
The proxy is sitting between my browser and the Udacity server,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.920
and since it's configured with an invalid certificate,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.060
Chrome stops me before I get to the website.
