00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.760
When working locally, developers often resort to using self sign certificates.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.585
These certificates refer to themselves as their own certificate authority.

00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:12.988
Since they are self signed,

00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:15.330
they don't provide any kind of authentication.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.365
Your browser will visibly complain and give you a red padlock

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:22.128
but it will let you test if your website has mixed content.

00:00:22.128 --> 00:00:23.950
So you need to launch the binary for

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.370
this project and load the URL it provides in your browser.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.725
You might notice that when you launch the server it

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:33.105
automatically generates a self signed certificate for you.

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:35.610
Since this is a self signed certificate,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.475
you might see an error page.

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:38.595
It's safe to proceed,

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:40.170
so click on advanced and then,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.090
click on the proceed link down at the bottom.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.160
You'll see the Udacity logo has been split up into multiple tiles.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.100
Are there any mixed content violations?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.150
And if so, which tile is causing the problem?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.000
Enter the tile info here.
