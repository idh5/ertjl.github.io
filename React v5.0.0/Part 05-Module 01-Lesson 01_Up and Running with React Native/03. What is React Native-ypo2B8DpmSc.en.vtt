00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.714
React Native allows you to use react to build native iOS and Android applications.

00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:10.596
Sounds too good to be true. Well, it isn't.

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:12.660
Companies like Walmart, Airbnb,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.060
and Tesla are all using React Native in some capacity on their mobile applications.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.469
In my opinion though,

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:22.729
React Native is even more beneficial to smaller startups.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.620
Instead of having a web team, an iOS team,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.083
and an Android team, with React Native,

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:30.560
you can just have a single UI team.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.680
This not only saves the organization a lot of money but also developer hours as well.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.500
Now, you may have heard the phrase,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.780
write once, run anywhere, before.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.060
The idea of this is that it would be nice if you could use a single code base on the web,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.565
on iOS, and on Android.

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:50.210
In practice though, this is pretty difficult.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.354
This is because each of those platforms have such a unique experience.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.939
Unlike write once, run anywhere,

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:58.695
React Native's motto is,

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:00.905
learn once, write anywhere.

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:02.292
Once you learn React,

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:06.614
you should be able to take those same principles and not only build UI for the web,

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:09.859
but also for native platforms like iOS and Android.

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.590
So instead of sharing the same codebase amongst all the different platforms,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.370
we're sharing the same principles.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.000
Things like component composition and declarative UI.
