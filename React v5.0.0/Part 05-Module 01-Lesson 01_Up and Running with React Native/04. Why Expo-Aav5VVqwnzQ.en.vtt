00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.985
Throughout this course, we'll be relying heavily on a service called Expo.

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:09.775
Expo basically makes everything to do with React Native a whole lot easier.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:13.460
The whole idea of Expo is that you shouldn't need to ever touch native code,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.265
whether that's Swift, Objective-C or Java,

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:18.199
when you're building a React Native app.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.285
As a JavaScript developer,

00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:21.934
I think that's a great mission.

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:24.379
So whenever we have to deal with the native API,

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:26.644
something like the camera or geolocation,

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:31.295
instead of having to deal with Xcode or Android studio, which trust me,

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:32.825
to be a huge pain,

00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:37.380
we can use Expo's JavaScript API to get the same results.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.583
I can't express just how influential and valuable Expo

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:43.274
has been on the React Native community.

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:48.339
Now, what's the relationship between the React Native team and the Expo Team?

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.150
Well, they're really close.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.299
Most of the main contributors to React Native work full-time on

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.140
Expo and some were even former Facebook employees.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.500
In fact, Create React Native app was built by

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
the Expo Team and is now the official way to start building with React Native.
