00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.735
Once you have both of your simulator set up and you've installed Create React Native App,

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:09.040
the next step we need to do is actually build our app.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.059
So what will do is head over to your terminal,

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.000
and you can run Create React Native App.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.935
And then the name of your app,

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:19.460
we will call our app that we're going to be building, UdaciFitness.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.050
This is very similar to create React app where we have create React app,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.785
or in this case Create React Native App,

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:29.405
and then need name of our application that we're building.

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:33.274
Once that is finished, you'll notice that we have some commands here that we can run.

00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:36.494
So what I'm going to do is just as it says here,

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:42.229
I'm going to cd into our app and then I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.244
So we have all of our code right here,

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.779
and just to show you what this looks like.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.984
Let's go ahead. And using yarn,

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:51.509
we will run yarn start to start our app.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.604
And as that's going, let me go ahead and show you what the code looks like.

00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:57.604
So you'll notice here that we have our main App.js file.

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:00.224
And this, if you're familiar with React which you should be,

00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:02.100
it should look pretty familiar to you,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.630
we have this View component.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.905
Inside of here we have a few Text components that we have are text inside of.

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:13.079
And then, the rest of this is really just configuration stuff.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.989
So now, you'll notice that when our app started,

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:17.754
we have a few options here.

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:23.619
If we press a, that will go ahead and run our app in the Android device emulator.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.935
Pressing q, will display the QR code which is just this right here.

00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:28.814
So if you have the Expo app on your phone,

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:30.539
you can go ahead and scan this.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.270
And as long as your phone is hooked up to the same network as your computer,

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:37.769
you'll see the app running on your local phone.

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:39.879
We can press r to restart the packager,

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:42.342
d to toggle development mode, or i,

00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:44.965
missed this, to open the iOS simulator.

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:46.320
Let's go ahead and press i,

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.084
it's going to start the iOS simulator.

00:01:49.084 --> 00:01:50.769
And now on my desktop,

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:55.959
you'll notice that we have this iOS simulator here with our text right here.

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.474
What's cool about this if I go and change this text,

00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:00.649
let's just say, opening up.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.765
You'll notice that we get live reloading here.

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:08.460
Then now, I also want to run this on my Android simulator right here, using Genymotion.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.409
So inside the terminal I will hit a.

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:18.000
And now we have the code running on our Android emulator over here as well.
