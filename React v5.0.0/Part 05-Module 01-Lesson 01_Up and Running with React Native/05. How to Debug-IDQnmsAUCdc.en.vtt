00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
So here we have the basic app running

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.929
from create React Native app on iOS as well as Android.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:09.419
And what I want to show you in this video is how to

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.150
open up the developer menus and both of these,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.242
and also how to debug an application,

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:18.170
so when the time comes you can easily do that.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.720
So, if you're using the iOS simulator over here,

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:27.089
go ahead and select it and then hit command D and that will open up this menu right here.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.914
You'll notice that we have a few options.

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:31.754
We can refresh, we can copy link,

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:33.854
we can disable live view, all of these things.

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:39.049
But what I'm interested in right now is this one right here called Debug Remote JS.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:41.564
If you go ahead and select that,

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:47.799
what's going to happen is React Native is going to open up another window.

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:49.754
So now in this window,

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:52.740
if we open up the console just as we're used to,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.745
you'll see some stuff going on here.

00:00:54.744 --> 00:00:56.769
Right. We have some warnings.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.630
And now if I wanted to put a debugger in my apple,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.055
say we want to debug whenever this component mounts.

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:07.635
All we need to do, just like we're used to,

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:10.469
is we will throw in a debugger.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.673
So here I would say, cancel that log,

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:18.329
let's say before, and then we will constitute a log after.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:19.950
So I hit save,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.704
that goes and refreshes my app because the live reload is on.

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:28.334
And then you'll notice, if we go back over to our console,

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:33.094
we are now in the console just as we are on the web.

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:37.370
And so what I can do here is you'll see that we got before,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.200
then we go ahead and step through this again just like we're on the web.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.329
We get after, everything is the same.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.129
So what's great about react native is the same development experience you're used to

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:51.929
on the web is the exact same with react native because we can log to the console,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.350
we can throw in a debugger.

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.134
Everything is so familiar.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:58.620
And so to get the developer menu on android instead

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.859
of hitting command D like we did in iOS on android,

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.810
you hit command M and we get the same option right here.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.644
But I want to go back to iOS real quick.

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:10.079
And I want to select one more option.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.710
You'll notice here that we have Toggle Element Inspector and this can be native.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.300
This is like kind of selecting elements on the web or I can click on any of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.390
these and I can get any style to apply to it as well as any padding margin.

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.804
Basically the box model inspector that we have on the web,

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:30.270
we can have this with react native and say,

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.330
I wanted to click on one of these without inspecting it.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.025
All we have to do is select this box right

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:38.314
here and then now when we click, it won't inspect.

00:02:38.314 --> 00:02:42.775
So we can toggle this on and off and to remove it again,

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:47.245
all we do is hit command D and then click on toggle element inspector.

00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:51.439
So there's a bunch of stuff you can do here with the developer options here.

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.509
The biggest ones you'll need are refreshing,

00:02:54.509 --> 00:03:00.000
toggle element inspector as well as starting and stopping the remote debugger.
