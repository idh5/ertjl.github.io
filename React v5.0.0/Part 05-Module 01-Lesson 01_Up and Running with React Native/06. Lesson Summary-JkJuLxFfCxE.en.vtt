00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
That's it for the very first lesson.

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:06.504
Awesome job. Let's summarize what we've learned so far.

00:00:06.504 --> 00:00:09.259
React Native allows you to take the concepts you've learned from

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.399
React and build native iOS and Android applications.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.885
Expo makes working with React Native a lot easier.

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:21.260
Create React Native App is the official way to create a new React Native project,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.040
and now you should have a dev environment set up on your computer.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.000
In the next lesson, we'll see just how similar React is to React Native.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
