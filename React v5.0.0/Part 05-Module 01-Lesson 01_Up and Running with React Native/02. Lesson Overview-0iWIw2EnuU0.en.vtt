Welcome to Udacity's React Native course.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.660
The goal of this course is to take you from React developer to

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.655
native iOS and Android developer using React Native.

00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:13.049
The good news is that most of the knowledge you already

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.703
have about React will come in handy when learning React Native.

00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:20.475
First, we'll take a high-level look at how React Native works.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:22.140
You know, the whole JavaScript building

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.890
the inner views in the phone thing, it's really cool.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.109
Then we get your dev environment configured and look at how debugging works.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.554
Next, we'll get our hands dirty by learning and building with React Native components.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:38.695
Then we'll see how styling and layout work followed by a lesson on navigation.

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:42.380
Finally, we'll move from working with React Native code to controlling

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.969
OS-specific features on iOS and Android like geolocation and notifications.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.000
We've got a lot prepared for you, so let's get started.
