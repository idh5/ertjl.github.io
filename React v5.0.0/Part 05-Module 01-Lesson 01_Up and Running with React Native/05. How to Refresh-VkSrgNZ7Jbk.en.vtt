00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
When we're developing for the web and something is weird,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.089
you can just refresh.

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.469
Typically, this isn't something you can do with

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.919
Native development because you need to recompile your code.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.080
With React Native, because you get

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.835
the same development experience you're used to on the web,

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:18.609
you can also refresh your app if you need to.

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.754
With the iOS and Android simulator,

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.349
just double tap R,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.875
and if you're on your phone,

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:26.539
just shake it, then press refresh.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.289
In a previous video,

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.729
I showed you how to open up the developer tools on both iOS and Android.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.059
On iOS, it was command D, and on Android,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.998
it was command M. And once you open up the developer tools,

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:44.125
you have the option to reload or to refresh your application,

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:46.710
but there's actually a shortcut for doing this and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.554
I prefer the shortcut because it's a little bit quicker.

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:51.435
On iOS, what you can do,

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:56.630
is hit command R and that will go ahead and refresh the app, as you're seeing there.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.455
And on Android, what you can do,

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:03.000
is double tap R and that will refresh the application on Android.
