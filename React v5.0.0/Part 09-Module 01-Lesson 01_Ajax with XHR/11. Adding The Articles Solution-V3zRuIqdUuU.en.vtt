00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
I have added the debugger and searched for line.

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.740
We can see that the response has a nested response object.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.449
And inside that the docs property holds all of the articles.

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.843
So we need to convert the response from JSON into a Javascript object.

00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:15.959
If some articles have been returned,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.200
then this section maps over each article and then returns

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.699
a list item that contains the article's headline and a snippet of the article.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.530
Finally, we combine all article list items together inside in unordered list tag.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.329
This gets added to the bottom of the page inside the response container.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.000
If there are no articles then it just displays the text "no articles available."
