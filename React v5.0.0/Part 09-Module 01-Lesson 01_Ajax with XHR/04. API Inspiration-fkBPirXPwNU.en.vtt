00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
There are tons of APIs available on the web

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:05.621
that readily serve up interesting information.

00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:07.474
And they're usually free to use,

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.184
so long as you aren't making thousands of requests per hour.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.665
For instance, Google offers a ton of APIs,

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:16.980
including Google Analytics, Google Maps, Google Fonts.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.403
Looking around the Web,

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.670
it isn't hard to find examples of websites that use

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.770
external API to create interesting interactions for users.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.269
Reddit and the Reddit Enhancement Suite Chrome plugin

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.019
interact with a few different APIs to make Reddit feel more dynamic.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.005
When a user clicks on a link that resolves to a YouTube video,

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:41.810
Reddit opens up an embedded YouTube player which interacts with the YouTube API.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.919
Or when a user opens up a link to a Twitter feed,

00:00:44.918 --> 00:00:49.119
the Reddit Enhancement Suite Chrome plugin fires off an Ajax request for

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:54.820
Twitter data and uses the Twitter API to open up the tweet right here inside the page.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.590
Check out the link in the instructor notes if

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.620
you want to find some more APIs that are available.
