00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.479
Let's see an asynchronous request in action.

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.080
I'm on Google's home page and have dev tools open over here.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.400
To see the requests being made,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.550
I'll switch to the network pane and then make sure it's actually recording.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.589
Now I'm going to do a search for Udacity,

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.079
but you'll see that right after I type the U,

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.551
a bunch of things will happen,

00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:25.823
the homepage has been replaced which I'm sure you're used to seeing a zillion times.

00:00:25.824 --> 00:00:28.340
But more importantly if we check over here,

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.625
we can see this request.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:33.950
See this XHR in the type column?

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.565
We'll be digging into this shortly.

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:40.259
But for now, just know that the XHR means it's an asynchronous request.
