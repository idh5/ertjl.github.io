00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.068
We just saw that running this code doesn't do anything.

00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:06.549
Well that's not actually true because something does happen.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.820
A request is actually sent.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.185
We can see this if we check out the network pane.

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:14.700
We want to record network traffic so make sure dev tools is recording.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.800
This is red so I know it's recording.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.190
If it's not red, then just click on it to turn the recording feature on.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.609
Now, if I come down here and run the request, it actually sends.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.859
See, here's the request.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.375
Let's stop recording for now.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.655
If I select the request we can see it's headers.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:34.380
Here's the URL that we requested and the request method.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.080
We can also see a preview of the request and then

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.829
the response paying contains the actual html of the response.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.934
So even though nothing happens to the page or in the code,

00:00:43.935 --> 00:00:45.539
the request is actually sent.
