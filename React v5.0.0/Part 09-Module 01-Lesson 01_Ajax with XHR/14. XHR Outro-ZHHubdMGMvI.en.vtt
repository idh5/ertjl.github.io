We just looked at using the XHR object to create and send asynchronous requests.

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.029
As you saw, there are a number of steps to create an XHR object,

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.559
handle a successful request,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.380
and deal with errors.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.770
It was a lot of code.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.945
Do we really need to write all of that code

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.079
every single time we want to send an asynchronous request?

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:20.987
When using the XHR object,

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.125
the answer is yes.

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:27.765
But you don't always have to use the XHR object to make async requests.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:31.960
You could use some third party library like jQuery to make the request for you.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.399
