00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
After the request returned successfully let's

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.969
pause inside the function to check out what's been returned.

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:08.625
To do that let's add a debugger right here.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.160
Now if I refresh the page and search for flamingos,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.519
it'll pause that this value is the XHR object

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.410
itself and the response is stored in response text.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.375
This is a Json response and shows all of the text.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.644
We can see this information a lot more easily in the network pane.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:26.945
This request returned 13 responses.

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:30.600
So we need to convert the response from Json into a JavaScript object,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.000
then format the data.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.064
Now, to get the first image.

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:36.734
Now that we have the first image,

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:39.420
we just need to add it to the page.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.570
This code will add a figure element with an image point to the image

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.164
from unsplash and a caption of the person that took the photo.

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:50.670
It will add this inside the response container as the first element.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.245
Now we also want to make sure that we handle the case if no images are returned.

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:58.408
This will check to make sure there's some image results returned.

00:00:58.408 --> 00:00:59.774
If there aren't any,

00:00:59.774 --> 00:01:02.329
then we'll just display a message that there are no images.
