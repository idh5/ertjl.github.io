00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.665
Let's hear our app in action.

00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:04.480
I'm interested in learning more about cake.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.745
Oh yeah, that looks amazing.

00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:08.714
Looking at the code one last time,

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:11.634
we set up a listener for when the form is submitted.

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:13.968
This kicks off our async requests,

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:16.905
one to Unsplash and one to the New York Times.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:18.929
When the Unsplash request returns,

00:00:18.928 --> 00:00:21.149
it calls the add image function.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:22.875
When the New York Times requests returns,

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:25.079
it calls the add articles function.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.883
Both of these functions convert the response from json,

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:31.795
extract the data, and then add it to the page, and that's it.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:34.545
A number of moving parts to handle asynchronous requests,

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:37.230
but by now all of this makes sense because you're a pro.
