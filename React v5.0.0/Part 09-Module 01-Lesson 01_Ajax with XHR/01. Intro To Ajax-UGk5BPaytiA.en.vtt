00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
Welcome to this course on Ajax.

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:05.062
The main concept of Ajax is simple.

00:00:05.062 --> 00:00:06.450
You make a request for some data,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.949
and then without pausing for everything to wait for the request of return,

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:12.160
You just move on and do something else.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.310
Then once the requests finally does get returned you deal with it.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.910
Really, that's Ajax in a nutshell.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.588
Now Ajax used to be an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML,

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.439
and you'll still kind of see it that way,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.375
but it's a bit of a misnomer now.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:30.890
Instead Ajax is the concept of asynchronously requesting data,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.399
whether that's an XML file,

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.649
a JavaScript file, or Json from a REST API.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.744
It really doesn't matter what the data is.

00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:41.390
You just request the data asynchronously and then deal with it when it comes back.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.929
In this course, you'll learn to make Ajax requests using JavaScript.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.695
First, we'll look at doing this with the tried-and-true XHR object.

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:53.920
Then we'll look at how jQuery makes Ajax requests in lesson two.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.560
And finally, in lesson three,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.350
we'll check out the new and massively improved way of making

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.149
async requests using the fetch API. You're gonna love it.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.239
So my mom's birthday is coming up soon and I need to make a cake for her.

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.459
So while I go to the store to get the ingredients,

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.409
some of my friends are going to help demo how

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.019
Ajax communication works when interacting with a server.
