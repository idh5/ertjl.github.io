00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
Ajax requests allow for content retrieval and display without reloading the web page.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.039
Asynchronous in Ajax refers to

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.285
the fact that the request doesn't block other events from happening.

00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:14.220
Instead, the page keeps on doing its thing and then only

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.280
acts on the data when it gets returned by the server.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.530
Ajax requests occur in a number of different ways and with varying levels of difficulty.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.554
Some require an API key, others use Oauth,

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:28.239
and some don't use any authentication at all,

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.769
and the data returned by different Ajax request differs too.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.679
X in Ajax stands for XML,

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.829
which used to be the dominant hierarchical data format.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.289
But today Json is much more popular.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.780
In fac, t most Ajax request nowadays are actually

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.135
AJAJ request standing for Asynchronous JavaScript And Json requests,

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:51.960
but it doesn't sound as nice so still just call them Ajax.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.875
Embedded within Ajax responses,

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:56.039
it's pretty common to see html,

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.000
which websites can use to fill in part of the page.
