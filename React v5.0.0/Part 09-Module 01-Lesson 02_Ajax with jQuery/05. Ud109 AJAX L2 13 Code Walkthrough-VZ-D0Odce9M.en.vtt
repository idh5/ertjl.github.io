00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.919
Here's the completed project that uses

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:05.549
jQuery's Ajax method to asynchronously fetch the data,

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.358
setting up the XHR object has been replaced with calls to dollar.ajax,

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:13.365
and the data is passed in directly as an object.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:17.460
When the response is returned it's handled by the done method.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.765
If there are any errors,

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:21.449
then the fail method will display an error message

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.269
letting the user know that content couldn't be loaded.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.739
Since unsplash returns a Json object,

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.650
the response will automatically get converted to Json by jQuery.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.149
Similarly, the New York Times request returns

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.659
Json data that will get converted to a regular JavaScript object.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.278
Pretty cool how jQuery handles most of the set up for us, isn't it?
