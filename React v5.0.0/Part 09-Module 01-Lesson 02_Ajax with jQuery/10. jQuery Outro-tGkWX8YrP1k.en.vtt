00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
In this lesson, we used the jQuery library to make

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:08.160
asynchronous requests and we use jQuery's.ajax method to do it.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.065
We also dove into the.ajax method and saw that deep in the underbelly of the code,

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:15.089
it just created an XHR object,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.079
set all the properties and callbacks,

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.269
and then sent off the request for us.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.285
So we've seen how to make async requests with XHR,

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:26.189
and now we just looked at using a middleman to handle the groundwork for us.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.420
In the next lesson,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.493
we'll look at the shiny new way to make async requests.

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:33.240
It'll be gluten-free, carb-free and even sugar-free,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.834
will it even be a cake at this point?

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.275
Who even knows? I can guarantee you this though,

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:39.000
it will be chocolate.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
