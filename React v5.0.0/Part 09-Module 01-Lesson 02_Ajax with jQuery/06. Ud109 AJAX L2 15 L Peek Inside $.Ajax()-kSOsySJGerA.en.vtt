00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470
This is the cake from the previous lesson.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.355
And this is the one that I just got back from the store.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:08.290
With this one, I did all of the work myself.

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.379
I added all the data, I set all the properties,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.145
and I hooked everything together.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:13.884
With the store bought cake,

00:00:13.884 --> 00:00:15.580
I didn't do any of that work,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.800
but someone else did.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.519
They had to go through all of the same steps that I did.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.669
So even though I'm calling it jQuery's.ajax method,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.105
somewhere in that code jQuery is creating an XHR object,

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:28.695
setting the right properties and methods,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:32.000
and then sending off the request. Let's check it out.
