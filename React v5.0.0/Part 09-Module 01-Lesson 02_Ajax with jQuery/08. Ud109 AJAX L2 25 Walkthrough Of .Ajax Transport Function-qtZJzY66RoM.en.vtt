00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.995
Here's the send function which is the third item in the call stack.

00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:09.759
This call creates a new xhr object and stores it in an appropriately named xhr variable.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.869
It then immediately calls the xhr.open method,

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.105
passes in the data that we've provided in the configuration object.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:18.839
It then makes its way down to the headers and then loops over

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.440
each one calling the setRequestHeader method.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.975
This code here sets up the callback function.

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:28.020
If there's an error in the request then this code will run.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.172
If the request completes successfully,

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:31.539
then this code will run.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.269
Down here is where the request is actually sent.
