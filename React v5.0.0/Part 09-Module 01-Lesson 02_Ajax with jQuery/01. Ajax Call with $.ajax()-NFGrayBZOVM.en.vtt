00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Welcome back. So it turns out that

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.919
the cake I made wasn't the prettiest thing in the world.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:06.415
It should taste great,

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:08.195
but it looks kind of awful.

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:12.265
Totally not something I can show up with and be proud of having at a birthday party.

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:14.625
So instead of me baking the cake and frosting it,

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.469
let's just have a professional do it.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:25.769
With this cake, I had to get all the ingredients,

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.454
combine them myself, watch it while it's in the oven,

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:30.594
make the frosting, and then actually frost it.

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:32.424
I had to do everything myself.

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:33.884
It was just too much.

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:37.259
Now, I just requested the bakery to make it for me.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:38.789
They're working on it now and will let me know

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.079
when it's ready to come back and pick it up.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.034
So, I'm not doing all the work this time,

00:00:43.034 --> 00:00:45.919
but that doesn't mean it's not being done.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.289
Someone there is doing all of the same steps that I did in the previous lesson.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.615
So when you use a JavaScript library like jQuery to make async requests,

00:00:54.615 --> 00:00:57.615
you just request the data and then jQuery does

00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:01.280
all of the hands-on work under the hood. Let's check it out.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
