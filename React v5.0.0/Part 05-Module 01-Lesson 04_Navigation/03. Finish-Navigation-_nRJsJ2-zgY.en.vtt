00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
Now before we finish up with our navigator section,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.970
there are just a few small changes that we need to make.

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:12.390
If you remember back to our AddEntry component that we made,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.280
we have these sections right here.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:16.890
Navigate to home and Route to home.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.405
So what we want to do, is whenever we submit a new day basically,

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.929
or whenever we reset the current day,

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.015
what we want to do is all of these things as well,

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:29.339
as navigate back to the home screen.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.589
So the way that we need to do that in this file,

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.435
is with this method called NavigationActions,

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:40.454
which is coming from the React Navigation package.

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:41.820
And the way we can do this,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.090
is let's go ahead and down here,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.120
make a new method, we'll call it toHome.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.464
And what this is going to do,

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:51.720
is it's going to call,

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.254
this.props.navigation.dispatch, so it's similar to Redux.

00:00:57.255 --> 00:01:02.400
And what we are going to dispatch, is NavigationsActions.back.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.920
So we want to go back,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.075
and where we want to go back from,

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:10.299
is the route that has the key of AddEntry.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.539
So we want to basically, go from where we are,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.980
back to where we previously were.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.219
And so now what we can do is right here,

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.739
we can say, this.toHome.

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:23.119
And here, we can say this.toHome as well.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.800
Now, you'll notice here that we're not

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.099
really worrying too much about the order of the way things happen.

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:30.629
You could get kind of picky about that,

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:32.009
I'm not going to worry about it,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.315
but if you want to, by all means feel free to.

00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:36.329
What I mean by that is, we're dispatching,

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.060
we're setting state, this is all kind of asynchronous,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.484
so it's all just going to happen.

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:44.310
But it works fine. But if you want to refactor it by yourself, by all means go ahead.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.790
So now let's go ahead and check at entry.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.535
So let's just enter in some information for the day. That looks great.

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:54.030
When we add a new entry,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.409
we get taken to our home view that shows this.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.759
And now what should happen, is when we reset,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.660
we also get taken back to the home view,

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.759
and then it says, "Hey,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.605
don't forget to log your data for today!"

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:06.000
Because we just cleared that.
