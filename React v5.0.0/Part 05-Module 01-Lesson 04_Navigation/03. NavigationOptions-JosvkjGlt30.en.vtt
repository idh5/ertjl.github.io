00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
So this is our entreaty Tab View for both Android and iOS.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.129
Wouldn't it be cool if in the header up here,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.275
we had the date for the specific day.

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:14.535
In this case, August 8, 2017.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:15.925
Well, good news.

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:17.440
We can actually do that.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.380
So the way we can do that is,

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:25.019
you'll notice that with our StackNavigator and also with our TabsNavigator.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.714
We passed an options as the second argument right here,

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:34.314
and then also right here under navigation options.

00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:37.364
Well if we want to dynamically set specific options,

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:42.862
we can do that in the component itself by adding a static property to it.

00:00:42.862 --> 00:00:44.564
So, we can come up here and say Static,

00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:49.655
we will say navigation options. It's going to be a function.

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:53.454
This function is going to be passed navigation.

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:54.659
So now what we can do is,

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.329
we can come out here and say, entryID,

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.489
which we are getting from this long property here that we're passing over.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.954
This is going to come from navigation.state.params.

00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:13.435
So again, where this is coming from is when we actually route to our EntryDetail view.

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:15.435
What we're doing is we're saying,

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:19.079
go to EntryDetail and pass along this entryID,

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.625
which is just the key for the specific day.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:24.105
So now what we can do is,

00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:28.980
we can return a title and whatever we put right

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.350
here is now going to be the title inside this header.

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:36.089
So what we want to do instead is,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.469
let's go ahead and format our date a little bit.

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.989
So we'll say year is going to be entryId.slice from zero to four,

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:52.049
and then month is going to be that exact same thing but going from five to seven,

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.349
and then day is going to be entryID.slice, everything after eight.

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.149
So then, what we can do down here,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.745
is using template strings,

00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:10.025
we can say a month slash day slash year.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:16.891
And then now, when we go to a specific date for our entry detail view,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.944
what we will see up here is the date itself.

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:21.854
And one thing I didn't mention earlier,

00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:23.519
that I really like about ReactNavigation,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.080
is notice here the transition on Android is very Android-y.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.745
There's that kind of pop up. And the transition on iOS is a whole different transition,

00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:39.551
because again, iOS is a very different platform than Android.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.109
It has a very different feel to it and the animations should reflect those feels.
