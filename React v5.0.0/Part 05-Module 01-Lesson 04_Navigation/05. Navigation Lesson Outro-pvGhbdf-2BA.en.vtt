00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.070
In this lesson you learned about routeing with React navigation.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.300
Tab navigator allows you to set up a screen with several tabs.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.600
Stack navigator provides a way for your app to

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.364
transition between screens where each new screen is placed on top of a stack,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:21.964
and drawer navigator is used to easily set up a screen with a drawer navigation.

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:23.914
Finally, you learned how to nest

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:27.049
the different navigators to get any routing flow you need.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.150
In the next lesson,

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.000
you'll learn how to extend the functionality of your app by leveraging native features.
