00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.105
In this lesson, we're going to learn all about routing.

00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:07.570
Admittedly, the routing senior react native is a little crazy.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.785
The solutions are great,

00:00:08.785 --> 00:00:11.935
but there are many different solutions with different trade offs.

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:15.130
The router that we're going to go with, is react navigation.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.460
The reason for this, is because it was built by a team at

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.414
Facebook and is the official routing solution for React Native.

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:26.609
Routing on Native is a completely different paradigm than routing on the web.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.259
When you're routing on the web,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.954
typically what you're doing is you're mapping a URL to a specific component.

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:36.899
On Native, instead of mapping a URL to a component,

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.344
the router keeps track of a route stack.

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:41.795
You can think of it like an array of routes.

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:44.280
So when you navigate around your application,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.865
the router pushes and pops routes off the route stack.

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:50.760
To introduce this new routing paradigm,

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:55.479
let's take a look at react navigations, tab navigator API.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
