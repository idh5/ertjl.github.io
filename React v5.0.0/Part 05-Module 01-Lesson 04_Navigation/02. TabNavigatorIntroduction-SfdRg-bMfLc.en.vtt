00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
What we're going to do in this video and a few other videos is we are going

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.109
to look at an introduction to react-navigation,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.335
which is a routing library for react-native.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.900
Now, react-navigation is all about navigators.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.339
You'll notice here that by default,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.894
they give us three navigators: TabNavigator, StackNavigator, and DrawerNavigator.

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:23.579
Navigators allow you to define your application's navigation structure.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.719
So what we're going to look at in this video is TabNavigator, and basically,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:29.789
what it's going to allow us to do is it's going to allow us to have

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.984
tabs on our app that we can switch back and forth from,

00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:34.469
and then render different components,

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.740
whether it's either the Home component or the Dashboard component.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.960
So what we're going to do is,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.734
say right here, let's create a new variable.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.570
We will just call it TabNavigator,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.200
and if you haven't already and you want to play around with this as well,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.625
go ahead and yarn add react-navigation.

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:53.670
So inside of TabNavigator,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.410
we pass an object,

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.809
and the properties on this object are going to

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.405
be the specific routes or the specific tabs.

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:04.364
So what we're going to do is we can come in here and say, Home,

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:06.299
which is going to be the first tab,

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.310
and we can come in here and say,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.375
we want the screen to be Home.

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:13.769
And the second tab is going to be Dashboard,

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:19.324
and we want the screen that is going to show to be this Dashboard component right here.

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:23.640
So now, what TabNavigator returns is that actual component.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.784
So what we can do is, down here,

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:29.039
we can actually just render the component as we're used to.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.420
So now, if we look at our app,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.284
you'll notice that this is iOS on the left and this is Android on the right.

00:01:34.284 --> 00:01:36.099
You'll notice that the layout and the styles,

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.009
it's a little bit different because what's going on

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.730
here is iOS has its own look and feel,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.195
Android has its own look and feel.

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:44.579
When you use TabNavigator on iOS,

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.495
you get tabs that look like this.

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:48.314
Notice you can't really see it too well,

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:50.799
but this text up here is changing.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.189
And then also on Android,

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.810
we can go ahead and switch back and forth between these two tabs as well.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.969
Now, if you want to add an icon

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.959
to this iOS app because it looks a little better without it,

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.464
what we can do is,

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:11.900
notice that we have already imported our icons from vector-icons.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.515
So inside of TabNavigator,

00:02:14.514 --> 00:02:19.989
what we can do is we can come in here and we can add some navigationOptions.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.610
We're going to give it a tabBarIcon,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.625
and then what we will do is we want to render FontAwesome.

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:29.103
The name of this is going to be home.

00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:31.147
We'll give it a size of 30.

00:02:31.147 --> 00:02:33.769
Color, we'll just say, black for now.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.677
And we're going to do something really similar for the Dashboard screen,

00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:41.250
but instead of home, this is going to be dashboard.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.375
And so now, notice that we have these tabs down here that we're switching between,

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:50.014
and what's nice about React Navigation is it's really customizable.

00:02:50.014 --> 00:02:53.704
If we look at the documentation just for TabNavigator itself,

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:55.630
notice here are some examples.

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.704
But down here, there is all these things we can configure.

00:02:58.705 --> 00:03:01.405
We can configure the tabBarPosition,

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:03.599
initialRouteNames, paths and then,

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.039
we can start configuring some of the styles whether it's the activeTintColor,

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:09.824
how to showLabel, the inactiveTintColor,

00:03:09.824 --> 00:03:10.949
all of these different examples.

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.579
So again, if you need to do something with React Navigation,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.250
odds are you can do it because there are a ton of options here.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.180
Now, it may get a little bit overwhelming because what you end up doing is passing in

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.409
huge objects like this to configure your routes.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.840
But again, it's nice because basically,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.000
anything you want to do, you can do it.
