00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.964
Now that we've talked about tab navigator as well as our stack navigator,

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:08.550
the last navigator we need to discuss is the DrawerNavigator,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.850
which is going to allow us to route using a drawer which

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.564
pops out either on the left or the right hand side of the screen.

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:17.714
So you'll notice here that we have two components.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:19.920
And now in each one of these,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.260
instead of just routing from

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.470
the home component to the dashboard component as we've seen before,

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:29.024
what we're going to eventually do is we will have this button and when we click on it,

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:30.314
no matter which route where in,

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:34.245
it's going to open the drawer so that we can navigate to the other route.

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:36.179
So the very first thing we want to do is,

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.039
let's come in here and we will create our drawer component,

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.344
which is going to be the result of calling DrawerNavigator.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:46.484
So the very first route,

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:48.049
as we've seen before,

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:49.334
is going to be our home route.

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:50.939
The screen is just going to be home.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:54.149
And then we will have the dashboard route and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.750
the screen is going to be the dashboard component.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.295
So now what we need to do,

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:03.445
because React Navigation is rendering both of these views,

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:07.099
it's going to be past navigation as we've seen in the past.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:08.879
So what we can do here,

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:14.054
is when this touchable opacity component is pressed,

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:17.380
what we can do is we can call navigation.navigate.

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:23.015
And now what we want to do is pass in the string drawer open.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.659
And what this is going to do,

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.625
is it's going to open the drawer,

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:28.290
which we will see here in a minute.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.390
So now we have it both on our home component as well as our dashboard component.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.825
And now the last thing we need to do is just render our drawer that we created.

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:45.935
So now, you'll see here we have our home view.

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:48.820
And we can open the drawer and we get the drawer pop out.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.689
And now, we can navigate between our two routes using the drawer.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.859
So let's go ahead and add a few alterations just really quickly.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.685
What I want to do is I want an icon to be shown in the drawer itself.

00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:07.905
So we as we've done before can add some navigation options.

00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:12.740
We'll say, drawer label is going to be home and then

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.860
we will say drawer icon is going to be a font awesome icon.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.355
The name is going to be home.

00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:24.694
We'll say a size of 20 and we'll give it

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:29.560
a color of black and then now I'm just going to copy and paste these down here.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.604
Now instead of home we will call this dashboard and we will change this to dashboard.

00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:37.340
So now what should happen when we open the drawer is we

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.175
should see these icons right here.

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:45.210
And we can still navigate between the two components.
