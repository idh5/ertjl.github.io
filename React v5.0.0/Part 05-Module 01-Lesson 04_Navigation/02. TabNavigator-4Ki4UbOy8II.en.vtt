00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.169
Our history view is now looking pretty good and if you remember,

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:07.094
we also have our AddEntry view,

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:08.820
which is also looking pretty good.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.914
We can't really go much further in our app without adding navigation.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:17.820
The very first thing we need to do is head over to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.250
your terminal and yarn add re-act navigation.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.789
Once that's done, go ahead and restart your app and head back over to your App.js file.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.799
What we're going to do here is,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.380
let's first grab platform because we'll need that for some styling and then go ahead and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.505
grab the TabNavigator off of react-navigation and then while we are here,

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:46.995
let's go ahead and grab a few colors,

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.675
purple and white from

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:57.420
util/colors and then we're also going to need to specify the specific icons,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.660
which are going to be on the tabs that we're about to build.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.689
What we'll use is Fontawesome as well as Ionicons.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.774
All right. Now what we want to do,

00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:14.715
is we want to actually create our tabs component so the way we can do that,

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:18.870
is we can invoke TabNavigator and

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.615
the first object we are going to pass it

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:25.204
is going to represent the tabs that we want to see on the screen.

00:01:25.204 --> 00:01:26.995
We will have history,

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:32.100
the screen we're going to render is our history component and let's go

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:37.334
ahead and give it some navigation options, the tabBarLabel.

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.634
What it's going to show on the tab bar,

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:47.415
is it will say history and then the tabBarIcon is going to be a function,

00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:49.680
which is going to take in a tintColor,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.820
which we will set here in a minute and we want to render this icon,

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.394
which is why we imported it,

00:01:55.394 --> 00:01:59.164
the name we will say is iOS bookmarks.

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:02.484
Size, we'll set it equal to 30,

00:02:02.484 --> 00:02:08.580
and then the color is going to be this tintColor so we have a history tab.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.215
Now we also need

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:14.319
our AddEntry tab because that was the other component that we built as well.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.629
Similar, the screen is going to be AddEntry.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.030
We're going to have some navigation options,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.715
tabBarLabel is going to be AddEntry and then the tabBarIcon is going to be a function,

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:37.814
which also accepts the tintColor and is going to render a Fontawesome icon,

00:02:37.814 --> 00:02:41.384
with the name of plus square,

00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:47.039
the size of 30 and the color is going to be tintColor.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.094
All right. These are

00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:54.060
our tabs and now what we want to do is we want to specify some options for these tabs.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.717
Specifically, things like how they look and whatnot.

00:02:56.717 --> 00:03:02.564
What we'll do is as the second argument to TabNavigator,

00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:08.049
we will pass it an object and we will say tabBarOptions.

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.340
It's going to have an active tintColor so this is going to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.520
be the color of the selected tab.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.255
What we want to do here is we will say,

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:20.534
if we're on iOS,

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:24.060
then this is going to be purple and if we're not then

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.860
it's going to be white and you'll see why we're doing that here in a second.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.180
Then now what we want to do is under tabBarOptions as well,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.395
we want to have some styling that we're going to apply to the tab bar.

00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:41.250
We will give it a height of 56, background color.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.205
Again, if we're on iOS,

00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:47.355
we want it to be white and if we're not,

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:51.239
then we want it to be purple and then let's go ahead and give us some shadow.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.460
I'm just going to paste this in so what we've done is we have a shadowColor,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.670
shadowOffset, shadowRadius and shadowOpacity.

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.679
I believe that looks pretty good.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.360
Now, what we have is,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.790
tab's as a component because that's what TabNavigator returns us.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.099
What we can actually do here is instead of

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.280
rendering history or instead of rendering AddEntry here,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.154
as we did earlier, we can just render tabs.

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:21.334
If everything is working right,

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:24.824
you'll see here, that we now have these tabs.

00:04:24.824 --> 00:04:30.144
What's nice here is Android has its own styling and so does iOS.

00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:37.250
Now, we can navigate between these two and one thing I want to add real quick.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.319
That won't affect us in this video but it'll affect us in the future,

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.170
is up here inside of our kind of options object.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.610
What I want to do is say navigationOptions,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.590
headers are just going to be set to NULL.

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:53.764
This is just going to get rid of any headers

00:04:53.764 --> 00:04:57.110
that we will eventually have in our app but we don't have right now.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.090
We'll save that. Again, everything looks good.

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:03.229
We can now navigate between these two components.
