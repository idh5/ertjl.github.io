00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.859
So now what I would like to do is I would like to add

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.919
a reset button to this UI so that when I click it,

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.550
it resets this information for the specific day.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.589
So what we will do,

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.140
is let's import a few methods here.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.370
The first one is add entry and if you'll remember,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.390
it is an action creator that we created a long time ago,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.990
and then the second one is going to come from our API file.

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:32.199
It's called remove entry and it's going to remove this specific entry from our database.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.770
Now what we need to do is let's go ahead and create a map dispatch to props function,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.200
which is going to take and dispatch and

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.986
then we will also get navigation coming from the props.

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:47.329
First thing, as we've done a few times,

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.350
let's go ahead and get the entry ID that we're passing

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.130
along and then what we want to do is we want to return two different methods.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.160
One, which is going to go ahead and remove the item for the specific day from our store,

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.844
and the other one is just going to allow us to navigate back to the home view.

00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:08.260
What we can do is remove.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.600
What this is going to do is it's going to call dispatch and then we are going to invoke

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:17.030
our add entry action creator and then now

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.909
what we are going to do is we will say entry ID.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.939
At this specific entry ID,

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.560
what we want to do is we want to say,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.359
we basically want to reset this.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.049
The problem here is, if you remember and this is where the app kind of gets tricky,

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.176
is if the day that we're setting is the current day instead of resetting it to null,

00:01:37.177 --> 00:01:42.220
we want to reset it to this right here.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.189
What we can say is up here in entry detail,

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.420
let's go ahead and import two different things.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.859
The first one is going to be time two strings so we get the ID of

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.500
the current day and then the second one is going to be get daily reminder value,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.829
which is going to give us that object for the day.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.465
Now what we can do is,

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:08.229
instead of here wher you can say we want the entry for this specific day,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.609
when we remove it,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.328
to be either if time two string equals the entry ID.

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:16.020
If we're on today,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.070
then go ahead and just make it whatever gets returned from get daily reminder value,

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.689
which is that way that says, "Hey,

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.740
don't forget to lock your data," or we set it equal to null.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.140
Now, the second thing that we want to add to this object is

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:40.000
say go back and all this is going to do is it's going to call navigation dot go back.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.240
All right. Now we have access to remove and go back

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.320
inside of our component so what we can do here,

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.459
is we can have a reset method.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.474
What this is going to do,

00:02:52.474 --> 00:03:00.204
so whenever we click reset what we want to do is let's go ahead and first grab remove,

00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:02.350
go back in the entry ID,

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.609
coming in from the stop props,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.375
and entry ID is coming in from right here in MapStateToProps.

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:13.000
Then what we want to do is we call remove.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.664
We call it go back,

00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:17.229
and then we call remove entry,

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:24.149
which is coming in from right here in our API file passing it the entry ID.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.650
This looks pretty good so far.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.647
Now, let's just set up a UI to invoke reset.

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:34.269
So what I'm going to do is import text button,

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.530
which is coming from the text button component and then now here,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.250
instead of this long thing,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.530
what we can say is text button and then here,

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.169
we can say onPress equals the this resets.

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.759
We will give it a style, say margin 20.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.139
The text we'll say is reset.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.179
Now, this looks pretty good.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.944
Let's see if we get any errors we do so we need to resolve action.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:07.909
I believe that should be actions.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.810
Alright. So, so far so good let's see how the UI looks, pretty good.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.000
One thing we're going to run into,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.834
if we hit reset as it currently is,

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:22.949
is what's going to happen is this component is going to re-render but then,

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.139
it's going to break because what it's going to try to

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.620
do is get state at the specific entry ID,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.100
which if it's not on the current day,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.367
is going to be null,

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:35.909
and then we pass all of those metrics into MetricCard, which then breaks.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.115
There's a few ways we can solve this.

00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:43.410
What I think is the most elegant way is what we want to do is we can say,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.390
should the component update and we can say if

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:57.539
nextProps.metrics does not equal null and nextProps.metrics.today is falsie,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.480
then the component should update.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.980
But if it's not,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.600
then we don't want the component to update.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.465
Again, what's happening here is when I click reset,

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:10.439
the component is naturally going to re-render even though we're going back

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:14.867
to home because the entry detail is still in the route stack,

00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:16.344
but what we're doing,

00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:19.620
we should about an update is we're saying don't re-render unless

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.845
nextProps.metrics does not equal null.

00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:30.530
So the day has current information in it and nextProps.metrics.today is falsie.

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:31.829
Without this line, again,

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:35.609
what would happen is MetricCard would render passing in metrics,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.850
which would just be undefined and then everything would just break.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.855
Let's go ahead and see if this is working properly.

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:44.480
We'll go to the 29th. Let's reset it.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.069
Remove is not a function.

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.939
Sure it is, it's the props.

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:52.139
We didn't even pass and map to special props as

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.990
the second argument so we pass that in and now,

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.975
I'm at least roughly confident this will work so we hit reset.

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:04.560
Now, notice August 29th instead of saying the information for that day,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.139
it says you didn't log any data on this day.
