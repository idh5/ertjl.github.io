00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.265
So far, we have only been requesting the server to send data to us using the GET method.

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:08.550
However, sometimes you might want the user to type in

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.960
some data or upload a picture and send that to the server.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.470
This is where the POST method comes into play that we mentioned earlier.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.865
With a POST request,

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:20.595
the request itself can also have a payload

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:23.745
or body something we have already seen in responses,

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.680
but not in requests.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.620
What exactly happens to the data once it has been sent to

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.115
the server is up to the backend developer and is not in the scope of this course.

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:36.480
It is, however, important to know that POST requests are potentially

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.435
handled differently by proxies and the browser than GET requests.

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:42.270
Have you ever seen one of these?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.730
This is what happens when the page you're currently looking

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.815
at was the result of a POST request.

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:50.175
If you try to reload such a website,

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.260
the browser will prompt you to confirm

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.290
this reload action as POST requests are allowed to be

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.765
destructive operations and repeating it

00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:01.280
might be more destructive than you originally intended.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.510
That's why it is usually recommended for the backend developer to not respond to

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.055
a POST request with a website but with a redirect to avoid this rather jarring behavior.

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:16.320
For the user, this redirect is practically invisible but avoids the prompt on reload.
