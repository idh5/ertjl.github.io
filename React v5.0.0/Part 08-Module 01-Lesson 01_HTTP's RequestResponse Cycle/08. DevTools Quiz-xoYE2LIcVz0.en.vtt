00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
In this exercise, you're going to count the number of

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.930
requests and the total amount of data being transferred over the wire.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.760
To help you accomplish this,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.005
you're going to use one of the most valuable tools of a web developer, Dev Tools.

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.860
All of the big browsers have their own form of developer tools with similar features.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.300
For simplicity's sake, we're going to use Chrome's Dev Tools.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.590
To open up Dev Tools,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.825
go to the menu, down to more tools,

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:28.565
and choose developer tools,

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:30.980
or just press command option I on Mac,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.810
or control shift I on windows.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.165
Then switch to the Network tab.

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:38.355
The binary for this server is in the download section below.

00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:40.775
So, launch it, go to the you URL it provides,

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:42.680
and you should see the same page.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.145
As the page is loading,

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:47.255
you can see all of the requests being fired off.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:52.360
Take a look at the requests to see the different headers and the responses.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.960
So, count the number of requests and the total amount of data

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.310
in kilobytes being transferred over the wire and enter them here.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.540
One quick note, to avoid incorrect results from plugins, extensions,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.610
and the browser caching the results,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.180
make sure to run this in an incognito window and make sure disable cache is selected.
