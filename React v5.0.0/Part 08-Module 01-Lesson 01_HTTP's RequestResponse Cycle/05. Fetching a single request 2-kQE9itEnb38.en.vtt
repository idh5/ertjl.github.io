00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
This part of the request is called the header section as it contains the headers.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.070
Headers are additional data about the request itself.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.340
A lot of these headers are standardized and contain information like;

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.620
what type of browser is making the request,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.440
what kind of format the browser supports and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.595
what version of the document is already available in the browser's local cache.

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:23.610
All of these headers are optional except for the host header.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.830
The smallest request that can be made would

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.215
only consist of the first line and the host header.

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:30.885
At a first glance,

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:33.740
a response looks very similar to a request.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.262
The biggest difference is probably the first line.

00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:39.980
Here you can find out the status code of a response that

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.815
indicates if your request was fulfilled successfully,

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:48.080
if the document was not found or if the server wants to redirect you somewhere else.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.670
Just like with a request,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.430
the next section is the header section.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.303
It not only contains data about the document,

00:00:55.303 --> 00:00:58.280
but also about the server and the connection.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.350
Again most of these headers are optional.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.245
The only obligatory header is content length

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:06.860
to tell the client how many bytes of data it should expect.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.539
After the headers and an additional empty line,

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.495
the actual document is sent.

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:17.580
This can be a JPEG image an HTML document or whatever you want to transfer to the user.
