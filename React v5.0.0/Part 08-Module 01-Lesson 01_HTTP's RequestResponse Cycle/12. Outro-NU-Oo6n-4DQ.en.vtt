00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.315
We have looked at the requests and response cycle of HTTP.

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:05.909
So now, you have a solid understanding on how HTTP

00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:09.290
works and what the browser actually does when you visit a website.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.430
You know how metadata is attached to both requests and responses

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.990
and you know how to request additional documents using JavaScript.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.780
Next, we'll take a closer look at the HTTP protocol and

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.000
the actual bytes that are being sent back and forth between the server and the browser.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
