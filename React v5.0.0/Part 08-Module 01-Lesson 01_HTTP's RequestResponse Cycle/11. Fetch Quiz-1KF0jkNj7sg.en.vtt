00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Fetch is so much easier to setup and work with instead of

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.780
battling against XHR and its unnecessary complexities.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.910
So we're giving you a chance to play with fetch.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.380
To complete this exercise,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.445
you need to fetch a file from a server.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.270
This is the server that you need to set up and interact with.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.285
But don't worry, it's not complicated to get up and running.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.735
The binary for this server is in the download section below.

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:24.435
So just download the project, launch it,

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:26.145
go to the URL it provides,

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.240
and you should see this same page.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.550
You need to fetch the file /password.txt.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.954
When you send the request,

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:35.745
you have to send it as a PUT request and include

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:39.495
the X-Udacity-Exercise header with some text.

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:41.490
If the fetch request is set up correctly,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.410
it will return the password.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.215
Enter that password here.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:47.275
If you want an extra challenge,

00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:51.730
try coding the fetch request from scratch instead of using the fetch builder form.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.485
This is definitely a bit more challenging,

00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:57.000
so I've included some helpful links in the instructor notes. Good luck.
