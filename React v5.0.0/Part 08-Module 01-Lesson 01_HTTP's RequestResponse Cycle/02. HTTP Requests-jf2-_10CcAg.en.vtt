00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
The Internet has been around for longer than the web.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.730
While computers already had something to

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.563
communicate with over the internet like e-mail or FTP,

00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:13.675
there was no common and publicly available way to publish and access documents.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:15.530
This is where Tim Berners-Lee comes in.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.450
He wanted an open mechanism for researchers to publish,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.445
read, and comment on papers through the internet.

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:25.300
He wanted to mesh off-link documents that were called hypertext documents.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.705
Berners-Lee shows a subset of SJML and called it HTML,

00:00:28.705 --> 00:00:31.515
the hypertext markup language.

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:37.650
Then he designed HTTP the hypertext transfer protocol to transfer these HTML documents.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.430
Hypertext sounds all futuristic and complicated but simply means that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.285
the text in the document can have references to other documents.

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.610
These references are called links.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.920
By getting a document,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.540
the user can not only read the documents but

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.600
they can navigate to related documents through these links.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.086
Especially in a scientific context for which Berners-Lee designed it,

00:00:58.086 --> 00:01:01.085
this feature turned out to be incredibly useful.

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:03.360
Hypertext can refer to more than text, though.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.920
Files can link to images,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.000
code, styles, or anything else.
