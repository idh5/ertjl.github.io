00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670
I've opened up Dev Tools and I'm on the Network tab.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.870
Here, we see an overview of the whole page as it's being loaded.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.935
Here is a table that lists out all of the requests with information about each one.

00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:14.710
Down here at the bottom,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.780
Dev Tools displays the summary for loading the page.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.225
This page had six requests and it transferred 43.5 Kilobytes of data.

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:26.170
So these are the numbers that the quiz was looking for.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.140
As you can see, Dev Tools is an invaluable resource

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.230
for a web developer and we'll be using it throughout the entire course.
