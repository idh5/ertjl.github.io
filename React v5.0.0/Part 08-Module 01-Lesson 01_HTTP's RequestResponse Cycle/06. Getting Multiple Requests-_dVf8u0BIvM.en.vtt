00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
We just saw how to fetch a single document using an HTTP request.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.090
These documents can be any kind of data really but on the web,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.045
everything usually starts with an index document.

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.900
The index document is what the server will send back to you

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.865
if no explicit file is defined in the request.

00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:20.225
By typing a URL in the address bar of the browser,

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:23.480
the user is instructing the browser to open a new connection

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.840
to the server identified by the host name in the URL,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.680
and getting the document specified in the path of the URL.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.310
In this case, the server will respond with the index

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.710
dot.html and the browser can start parsing it.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.080
This is a really interesting step and the browser does

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.050
a number of things to handle and receive data.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.285
Check out the link in the instructor notes for an explanation on how this works.

00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:48.380
After the browser has parsed the response,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.560
things start to get a little wild.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.450
As the browser is reading the index.html,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.265
it will probably find references to

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:58.300
other documents needed to properly display the website.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.050
These can be images, stylesheets,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.420
JavaScript files, videos, you name it.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.200
For each of these resources,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.080
another request is sent and once the response is received by the browser,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.420
this entire process of parsing and potentially sending new requests is repeated.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.292
That also means that each of these resources can in turn pull in additional resources.

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:23.760
Each landing page will have its own set of dependencies like images,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.020
CSS, and JavaScript files.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.820
That means that visiting a single URL

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.190
can send off many more requests than you might be aware of.
