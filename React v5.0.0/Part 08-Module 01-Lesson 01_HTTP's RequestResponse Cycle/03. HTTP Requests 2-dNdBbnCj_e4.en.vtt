00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
How does HTTP work?

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.965
In its original form,

00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:06.150
Berners-Lee came up with a template that you can

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.180
fill in to make a request for a document on a server.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.310
The original protocol, later called HTTP 0.9, was incredibly limited.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.200
You fill in if you want to retrieve or store a document,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.315
where to store the document including the name

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:25.410
and any additional information you think is necessary.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.030
This request has been handed to the server.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.840
Since the server speaks HTTP,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.950
it knows that this is an HTTP request and can therefore understand what the client wants.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.100
The protocol also has templates for the responses.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.230
These are a bit more versatile since a single request

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.525
can have a variety of outcomes including errors,

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:46.795
unreadable request forms, or re-routing the client to a completely different server.

00:00:46.795 --> 00:00:50.295
Luckily, Richard did a good job and I know what he wants.

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:53.700
The only thing left for me to do is fill out this form so Richard knows

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.035
which request I'm responding to.

00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:08.000
Bandwidth problems.
