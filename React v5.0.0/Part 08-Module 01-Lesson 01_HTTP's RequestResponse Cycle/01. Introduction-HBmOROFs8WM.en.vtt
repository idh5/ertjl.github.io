00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.570
Cheerio. Sorry, I can't do it.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.170
Can't do the cheerio?

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.355
That was part of the script.

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:15.297
That was good.

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:18.025
Welcome to Client Server Communications,

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:19.640
a course about the web.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.470
Technically, the web is only a small part of the internet.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.200
However, it is the only part of the internet that people use

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.676
without even realizing that what they're using is the web.

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:31.775
The web is the platform that you,

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:35.790
the web developer, can use to publish your ideas to the world.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.182
It is the common language between your servers and your clients.

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:42.340
Every time you open a browser,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.975
every time you download an app,

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:48.135
every time you receive a message on WhatsApp or Facebook, you're using the web.

00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:50.710
Or more generically, in that very moment,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.160
a client is communicating with a server and vice versa.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.868
But what does that actually mean?

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:58.590
What's happening when you navigate to a website?

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.435
How did the phone know that somebody sent me a message?

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.320
What capabilities does the web have?

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.935
And more importantly, what are its limitations?

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:07.900
Hi, I'm Surma.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.455
I'm an engineer at Google in London and I work with the Chrome team.

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:15.415
In this course, we're going to understand what the web actually is,

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:17.358
how we can use it to your advantage,

00:01:17.358 --> 00:01:19.390
and how you can avoid mistakes that will make

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.055
both your user experience and security suffer.

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:26.515
Some of this may seem like a review to you, and it is.

00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:29.885
But we will also go into the lesser known parts of HTTP.

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:31.270
To think like an engineer,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.768
you need to understand both the semantics of HTTP users,

00:01:34.768 --> 00:01:37.570
as well as the implementation inside the browser.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.800
We'll use that knowledge to use browser APIs to the fullest potential,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.485
secure HTTP against eavesdroppers,

00:01:44.485 --> 00:01:48.025
and deploy the web's newest protocol, HTTP/2.

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:51.220
All this knowledge will help you make informed decisions for

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.020
your app and persuade others when optimizing and securing their apps.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.050
Hi, I'm Richard.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.650
A course developer at Udacity and an experienced web developer.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.770
While Surma teaches you about HTTP's request and response cycle, security,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.890
and the best practices of HTTP/2,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.310
I'll be here to reinforce this knowledge with examples and quizzes.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.120
Understanding both the capabilities and limitations of the medium we work in on

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.470
a day to day basis will help you take the next important step towards mastery.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.995
By the end of this course,

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:23.070
you will understand literally every byte that is

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.000
being sent from your browser to the server and back.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
