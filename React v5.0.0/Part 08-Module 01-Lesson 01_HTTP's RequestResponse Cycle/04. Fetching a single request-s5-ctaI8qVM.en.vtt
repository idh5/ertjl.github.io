00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
The tubes and forms are basically the underlying concept of HTTP, request and responses.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.170
Well, we're not really going to be shoving paper through tubes,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.200
but rather, data through network cables.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.860
This is what an actual request looks like.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.000
This is the exact text the browser sends to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.320
the server to request an image called kitty.jpg.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.390
Let's dig into the first line a little bit.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.750
In this case, we are trying to get a document from the server.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.980
The protocol is also able to add,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.560
delete, and update documents.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.925
To distinguish between these capabilities,

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:38.215
the first line starts with an HTTP method or verb.

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:40.320
This request uses the get method,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.635
which means we want the server to send data to us.

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:46.005
Another example of a method is post,

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.355
which instructs the server to save the data we are sending.

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:51.225
There are more methods than these,

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.525
but we'll worry about them later when we talk about REST APIs.

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:56.580
Let's get back to the original request.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.165
After the method comes the path and name of the document we would like to get.

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:03.895
Here, we want the server to send us a file called

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:07.755
kitty.jpg located in the pictures directory.

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:12.445
The last thing in the first line is the version of the HTTP protocol we are using.

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:17.475
As of today, HTTP1.1 is the most common and widely supported version.

00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:23.225
However, HTTP2 is slowly catching up and taking over as the de facto standard.

00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:26.190
More on this later. Surma is now going to show you

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.220
the different kinds of headers an HTTP request can have.
