00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.095
We need to fetch the file password.txt,

00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:04.830
so I'll add that here.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.250
Then we need to use the PUT method and we

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.940
need to send along the letter X-Udacity-Exercise.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.005
The text here can be anything,

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.425
so I'll just set it to fetch rocks.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:19.230
Sending the request gives me the code.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320
Great job.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.745
So, did you try coding the fetch request yourself?

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.740
Let me quickly show you how I did it.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.550
Basically, it should look the same as over here except we need to handle the response.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.720
A fetch request returns a promise,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.200
so I'll chain onto that.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.560
In here, I'll get the response and return its text.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.645
This is another promise so I'll chain on another then.

00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:44.275
Finally, this is the password that gets logged out.

00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:49.000
Great work. Hopefully, you can see how fetch makes requesting files so easy.
