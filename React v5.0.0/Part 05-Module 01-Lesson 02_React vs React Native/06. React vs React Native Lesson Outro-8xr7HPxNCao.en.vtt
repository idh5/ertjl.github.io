Congrats on finishing lesson number two.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.429
To recap, we learned about the differences between

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:09.594
developing for the web and native experiences and,

00:00:09.595 --> 00:00:13.440
how important it is for React Native to keep the consistent feel.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.003
We work through all of the key React Native components,

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:21.646
we followed that up with learning about how to use AsyncStorage to save data locally,

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:25.910
and finally, we learned about adding Redux to a React Native app.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.829
Next up, we'll cover everything to do with layout and styling in React Native.
