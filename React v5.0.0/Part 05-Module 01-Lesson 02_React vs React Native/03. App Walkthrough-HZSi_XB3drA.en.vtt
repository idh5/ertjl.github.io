00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
What I want to do in this video is just give you

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.790
a complete overview of the app that we will be building.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.140
So as you're building it with me,

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:08.949
you know exactly what we're doing.

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.689
So it's going to be a triathlon tracking app.

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:13.529
So if you're not familiar with what a triathlon,

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.619
is it's basically an event where you run, swim, and bike.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.795
On top of that, we're also going to track

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.780
our current meals or how we're eating for the specific day,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.970
as well as how many hours of sleep we get.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.899
So you'll notice here that we have this history view.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.459
And for the day,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.314
if you don't log your information or if you haven't logged your information for this day,

00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:35.159
you're going to get a little reminder saying: hey,

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.149
don't forget to log your information.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.659
We can open up the calendar here and then we can

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.569
go ahead and scroll through this, if we wanted to.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.579
Let's select August 8th.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.134
When we select that, what we're going to get is every day from August 8th

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:52.109
on as well as our specific data for that day.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.560
You'll notice here on August 12th,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.955
we didn't log any data.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.449
So instead of getting a little card like this,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.145
we just get: hey, you didn't log any data for this day.

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:03.540
And let's go ahead and not leave Android out.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.519
It's going to be the exact same thing on Android.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.164
So now what we can do is we can click on one of these days and we get taken to this view.

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:12.030
It has the date right here as the header, all of our information.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.680
And allows us to also reset and clear the information for that specific day.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.510
So now, on August 11th this will say: hey,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.240
you didn't log any information because we cleared that.

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:24.269
So now, we can come on here and we can add a new entry.

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:27.444
This is how you add or log the specific information for the day.

00:01:27.444 --> 00:01:29.459
You'll notice here that a few things are different.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:32.309
The styles on iOS look a little bit different than on

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.105
Android just because they are two unique, distinct platforms.

00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:39.180
So here, what we can do is we can come in here and we can

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.325
log some information for the current day. Submit that.

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.480
And now, if we scroll up,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.120
scrolling on the simulator is always a problem. So we go to the current day.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.925
And now we have the information that we just barely logged.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:58.959
And the last thing that we can do, and again,

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.094
if you come to the add entry screen after you logged your information,

00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:03.280
you're going to get this view and this will say,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.564
hey you're already logged your information.

00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:07.474
And the last screen, the screen is kind of fun,

00:02:07.474 --> 00:02:10.030
what it's going to do is it's kind of like a real time tracker.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.310
So, it's going to tell you which way you're currently

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.965
heading as well as your altitude and the current speed you're going.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:20.295
I have the simulator set to simulating a drive on the freeway, right now.

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:23.964
So you'll notice we are going 70 to 71 miles per hour.

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:26.325
We are currently heading West.

00:02:26.324 --> 00:02:28.964
So that's basically the whole app that we're going to be building.

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:31.155
There's a lot to it. It's a pretty big app.

00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:33.655
So there are a lot of videos of us building it.

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:35.034
But if you stick with it,

00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:37.000
you will not be disappointed.
