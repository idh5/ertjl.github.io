00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.345
From a technological standpoint,

00:00:02.345 --> 00:00:04.860
React Native does a great job of letting you take

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.324
your experiences on the web to build native applications.

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:11.429
What's critical to understand is that the experiences you're

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.509
developing for on mobile are fundamentally different than on the web.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.179
Not only are native apps different than web apps,

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.509
but iOS apps are different than Android apps.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.295
If you took an Android Style app and put it on iOS, it would just feel weird.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.910
In this lesson, we're going to cover the subtle differences you need to watch

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.259
out for when building for the web, iOS and Android.
