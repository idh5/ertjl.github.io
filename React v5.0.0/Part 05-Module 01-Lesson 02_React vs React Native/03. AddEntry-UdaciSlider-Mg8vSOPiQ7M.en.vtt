00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
So instead of having the word you UdaciSlider for our slider,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.467
Let's go ahead and build out

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:11.080
our UdaciSlider component using react-native slider component.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.140
So inside of UdaciSlider,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.533
the very first thing we're going to do is we can get rid of text,

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.619
and we are going to import slider.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.062
And then now, if you remember,

00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:26.415
when we use UdaciSlider, it's down here,

00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:30.445
what we're doing is we're passing it a value and onChange,

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:37.049
and then everything else that is coming from our metaInfo information right here.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:38.529
So what we're going to do is,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.329
let's go ahead and restructure all of these.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.189
We'll have max, unit,

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:45.369
step, value and then onChange.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:47.979
And then now, what we want to do is,

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.204
let's render our slider component.

00:00:50.204 --> 00:00:52.479
Again, this is just coming from react-native.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.579
It is a built in component,

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.304
and what we want to pass it,

00:00:56.304 --> 00:01:01.225
is step as well as the value.

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:03.097
And then we will give it a,

00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:08.379
it's called maximumValue, which we call the max.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:13.060
The minimumValue, we'll just set to zero.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.540
And then, onValueChange, that's where we will

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.560
pass our onChange method that we're passing in.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.635
And now, let's go ahead and also render

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:29.980
a few other things because what we want to do is show the value,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.880
and then we also want to show the unit.

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:37.329
So again, the end result of this is going to look like this,

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.394
where we have our slider as well as our value and the unit.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:47.049
So this whole thing right here is our UdaciSlider component.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.128
And that looks good. Let's go ahead and save that,

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:51.655
and we'll look at our Apps.

00:01:51.655 --> 00:01:56.900
I can't find text because we got rid of it for some reason.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.685
Now, we are good.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.600
So notice as we slide this,

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.939
either one of these,

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:10.000
the value is going up right here and same thing on our Android emulator.
