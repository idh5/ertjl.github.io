00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.870
So now that we have our getMetricMetaInfo function all set up,

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.724
let's go ahead and use it.

00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:09.369
This brings us to building our very first component.

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.344
So let's go ahead and make a new folder here. We'll call it components.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:14.815
And inside of here,

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.954
let's create an AddEntry.js file.

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:21.195
And so we are going to import React from React.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.399
Let's also grab components,

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.384
as we've seen just in normal react on the web.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:27.600
But now what we want to do,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.740
is let's go ahead and grab,

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.420
View and Text from React Native and then let's go ahead

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.225
and grab that getMetricMetaInfo function that we just barely built,

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:43.245
that lives inside of utils/helpers and

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:48.794
then now our very first to React Native component is going to be this AddEntry component,

00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:51.880
which is going to extend components.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.175
And for now, let's just go ahead and return a UI

00:00:56.174 --> 00:01:00.869
that has a view and then we will give it a text of AddEntry,

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:02.625
just so we know that it's working.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.939
And then now inside of our app file,

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.390
first let's go ahead and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.905
delete a lot of the stuff that we're not going to be using for right now.

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:11.849
So let's delete all of this,

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:15.839
as well as the style.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350
And then we can delete both of these.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:23.189
And then to be controversial let's delete the semi colons.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.039
Alright, so now what I want to do real quick is let's import

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.915
that AddEntry component that we just made.

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:37.065
It's going to be coming from component/AddEntry and then now let's render it.

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:40.075
So what we should see if everything's working correctly.

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:41.495
Looks like we have a typo here.

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:44.670
So, unexpected token 142 on helper's.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.560
So util/helpers 142, let's unminimize this,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.090
and down here I think what our issue is,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.189
is we have type here instead of typeof.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.780
Type obviously isn't a thing.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.969
So now go ahead and see if this works.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.329
Typically with iOS you have to refresh it.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.174
So you'll notice now up here,

00:02:05.174 --> 00:02:07.489
behind the status bar, we have this text.

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.144
So the status bar is hiding are our AddEntry text but eventually we'll fix that.

00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:12.719
So it looks like our component is working.

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.254
So let's go ahead and just test one more thing.

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:18.389
What I want to do here is instead of having AddEntry,

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:19.974
so we can delete text.

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:23.129
Let's go ahead and show one of the icons from

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.430
our getMetricMetaInfo function that we created earlier.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.605
So let's invoke this,

00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:29.935
let's pass it bike,

00:02:29.935 --> 00:02:32.550
just so it has the specific metric.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.435
And then we will say, I believe it was getIcon.

00:02:35.435 --> 00:02:42.120
Yes. So then we can say getIcon then now what we should see up here is we have the bike.
