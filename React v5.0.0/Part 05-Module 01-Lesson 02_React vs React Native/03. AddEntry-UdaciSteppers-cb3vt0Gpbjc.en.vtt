00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
And now, just as we did with our sliders,

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.860
let's go ahead and update our UdaciSteppers component.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.935
So, in UdaciSteppers, we're going to need a few different things.

00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:14.100
These are going to be buttons,

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.664
so we will import TouchableOpacity,

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:21.655
and then we are also going to want to grab some icon components.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:25.393
So we will grab FontAwesome as well as Entypo,

00:00:25.393 --> 00:00:27.414
I think that's how you pronounce that.

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:35.219
And both of these again come with create React Native app under expo/vector-icons.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.729
And so, if you remember just like with UdaciSlider,

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:44.489
we are giving UdaciSteppers value onIncrement onDecrement and everything else.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.000
So we can come up here and destructure it.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.024
We will say max, unit, and step,

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:54.929
value onIncrement, as well as onDecrement.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.984
And then what we're going to do is instead of returning the text,

00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:03.259
we are going to return a few different things.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:07.064
The first one is going to be a Touchable component,

00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:08.789
and whenever we press it,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.745
we are going to run onDecrement.

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:16.135
Inside of here, what we're going to have is an icon,

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:18.594
the name is going to be, minus,

00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:21.810
we'll give it a size, let's say 30,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.460
and then we will give it a color of black so that we can see it right now.

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:31.250
And then we also want another button here,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.760
but instead of decrementing,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.090
we want to increment and then instead of minus,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.280
what we want is plus.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.150
And then now, let's go ahead and wrap these in a view.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.050
So right now, what we've done is we have built both of our buttons.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.649
But just like with the slider,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.469
we also want this stuff over here,

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.715
the specific value and the unit.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:03.855
So what we will do is add a bracket there and then what we will do down here,

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:10.245
we will have a view with two different text components inside of it.

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:16.830
The first one is going to be the value and the second one is going to be the unit.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.225
So now, what should happen if everything is working,

00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:21.754
and of course, it is not.

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:24.400
Oh, it is, we just had to refresh.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.435
All right, so now what we have is we have our buttons,

00:02:27.435 --> 00:02:33.000
we can press these and they will go up and they will go down.
