On Native, a slider is a pretty good way to have a user

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.525
select a number between a low number and a high number.

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:14.199
Luckily for us, React Native comes built-in with a slider component.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.594
So what we'll need to do is let's add some state to our component.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:21.070
We'll just say value and set it equal to 0.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.160
And then now, we can render

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.310
the slider component and we're going to pass it a few different props.

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:33.089
The first one is going to be the value which is coming from this.state.value.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.890
Next, we want to tell slider how to update the value.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.255
So we say onValueChange,

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:44.040
this is going to be a function which is going to receive the new value.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.984
And then, we can call the this.setState.

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:53.784
And then, we can update that new value if we saved this.

00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:58.644
And let's go ahead and add a text item down here and we'll just say Value,

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:03.340
so we can see what the current value is on these states.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.420
All right, so on Android,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.375
it looks like this and on iOS,

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:07.810
it looks like this.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.640
So again, what's nice about React Native is we have

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.700
these cross-platform components that

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.570
have the same look and feel based on whatever platform they're on.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.794
So now, say we wanted to add a minimum value and a maximum value to our slider.

00:01:21.795 --> 00:01:24.439
What we can do, as you probably guessed,

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.859
is we can say minimumValue,

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:34.405
let's say for some reason we wanted it to be -10 and the maximum value to be 10.

00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:38.379
So when we say that, you'll notice because we're starting at 0 we are in the middle.

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:40.509
But we can go between -10 and 10.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.469
And the last thing we can do is say we don't want these decimals here,

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.450
we just want clean numbers.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.295
So we can say step,

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:50.019
we want to step with 1.

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.854
So what's going to happen here is every time we move,

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:55.960
it's going to adjust the slider by 1,

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.349
regardless of what platform we're on.
