00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.445
What I want to do in this video is talk a little bit more about forms in React Native,

00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:09.120
and specifically this text input component and this switch component.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.419
So on our state,

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.455
what I want to do is let's go ahead and add some properties here.

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:18.745
Say inputs which will just be my Twitter handle and we will say,

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:21.030
show input and set that to false.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.990
So what we want our UI to look like is,

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.349
we want a little switch button that when it's on,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.920
we show the text input that we can change.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.890
Once off, we hide it.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.740
So what we will do here is,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.260
let's go ahead and first render the switch component.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:41.259
And we need to pass it, two different things.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:43.689
The first thing we're going to pass it is the value and

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:47.945
the second thing is the function that's going to be called when we press it.

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:49.149
So what we're going to do,

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.119
let's go ahead and destructure both of our properties on our states.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:00.739
And then, we need to go ahead and create a handle toggle switch function.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.609
And again, what this is going to do is it's going to be responsible

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.109
for updating the switch states.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.189
So what we can do here is,

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.575
we can say show input,

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:16.270
is going to be the opposite of whatever it currently is.

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:18.354
So whenever this function runs,

00:01:18.355 --> 00:01:20.859
switch input is going to toggle.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.054
So now what we can do is we can come in here and say,

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:26.440
value is going to be show input.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.349
And on value change,

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:33.714
we're going to go ahead and give it the start handle toggle switch.

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:35.000
So now, what's going to happen,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.939
is you'll notice in our UI,

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.814
we have this toggle switch button right here.

00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:41.319
And we can toggle on and off,

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.059
which is updating this show input property on our state.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.740
And so now, what we need to do is actually add in our text input.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.015
So what we're going to do is we'll say,

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:55.030
if show input and equal to true then what we want to do,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.439
is we want to show this text input component.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.694
And we actually want to be able to change the text input,

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:04.164
obviously, so we need to do a few more things.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:06.590
We can give it the input itself.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.200
We can give it some style,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.289
which I have created down here below, if you didn't see those.

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.189
And then what we're going to give it is a function that

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.469
will be called whenever it changed so we can update our local state.

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.060
So we'll say, start handle text change and then handle

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.020
text change is going to be a method on a component and what it's going to do,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.665
is it's going to receive the brand new input and then,

00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:33.639
it's also going to call set state.

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:38.674
And then, what it is going to do is it's going to just update the input.

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:42.219
So now, when we run this,

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.949
when we click toggle on,

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.030
you'll notice that we get this input.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.875
And then, we can now come in here and we can change the input.

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.944
So what happens if,

00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:58.544
say we wanted to add an image to our UI.

00:02:58.544 --> 00:02:59.869
So let's say right here,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.460
we had an image,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.570
let's import our image component.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.465
So everything looks pretty much the same.

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:08.865
A toggle on the input.

00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:12.439
But now what happens when I click on the text input,

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.234
you'll notice that the keyboard came up and it actually hid the input,

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:19.100
which isn't really a good idea.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.599
So what we can do to avoid that,

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.814
is React Native has this keyboard avoiding view component.

00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:27.469
So instead of having view here,

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.849
what we can do, is we can change that out with keyboard avoiding view.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.715
And then we can give it a behavior prop,

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.640
and we will just say padding.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.509
That's going to specify how the view is going to avoid the keyboard.

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.709
We'll just go ahead and add some padding around it.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.165
So now what will happen, is we toggle on the input field.

00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:52.069
We hit that and you'll notice that instead of hiding the input field,

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.044
the whole view rose.

00:03:54.044 --> 00:03:55.894
And now we still see the keyboard,

00:03:55.895 --> 00:03:59.000
but we also still see the input field.
