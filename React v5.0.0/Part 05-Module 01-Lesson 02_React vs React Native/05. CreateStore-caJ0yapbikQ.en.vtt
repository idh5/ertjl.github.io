00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.924
Now that we have our actions and our reducers,

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:07.375
the next thing to do is basically just hook up

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:11.949
Redux into our application using Provider and using createStore.

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.293
So to do that, now,

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:18.490
we actually need to go ahead and add Redux and React Redux to our application.

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:20.695
So just as we would do on the web,

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:23.335
we're going to say, yarn add.

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:27.530
Let's add Redux as well as React Redux.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.832
And then once that's finished,

00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:31.009
go ahead and restart your app.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.649
And then inside of our App.js file here,

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.939
let's go ahead and import a few things from those packages we just barely installed.

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:44.945
We will need createStore which is coming from just the Redux package,

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.990
and we will need Provider,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.995
which is coming from React Redux.

00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:52.555
And then let's import our reducer,

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:59.449
which is coming from the reducers folder that we created in the last video.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.200
And then now, again, just as we would do on the web,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.579
in order to hook up redux into our application,

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.799
we wrap everything inside of this Provider component.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.114
And then what we need to do is we need to pass Provider

00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:23.000
a store which we can get by calling createStore and passing in our reducer function.
