00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Now, as I mentioned before,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.944
when we hit submit instead of an AddEntry or reset,

00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:09.890
we're also going to want to update redux.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.225
But, in order for us to do that we actually need to add redux to our application.

00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:16.149
So then what we're going to do in this video,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.059
is before we add redux to our app,

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:21.334
we are going to make a brand new folder,

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:24.400
we'll call it actions and we will just define all of

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:29.054
the actions that are going to occur that need to update our redux store.

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:30.190
So instead of actions,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.620
we will have an index.js file.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.119
And if you think about our app again,

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:38.384
this is the main screen and this is the add entry screen, what we're working on.

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:42.609
There are really two type of actions that will go ahead and update our redux.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:43.780
For the very first one,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.465
is when we enter in a new entry for the day.

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:50.005
And the second one is whenever we go and fetch

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.460
entries from our database and we get those back.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.689
So with that said,

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:00.879
we will have two different constants up here.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.795
The first one we will call it receive entries,

00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:09.010
and that's for whenever we go and we fetch entries,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.630
or we fetch all of the days from our calendar from our database and we get those back.

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:16.405
And the second one is going to be

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:20.950
AddEntry and that's for whenever we click on this button right here.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.980
So now what we want to do is let's create our action creator,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.960
so it's going to be two of them.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.879
The first one we will call it receive entries.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:34.104
It's going to receive all of the entries and then it's going to return

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:37.120
an action which has a type

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.905
of receive entries and it's just going to pass along the entries.

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:43.840
And the second action creator we're going to make,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.545
we will call it AddEntry,

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:48.430
it's going to as you probably guessed, receive an entry.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.120
And then it's going to return an action or just an object which has a type of AddEntry.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.160
And then it's going to pass along the entry as well.
