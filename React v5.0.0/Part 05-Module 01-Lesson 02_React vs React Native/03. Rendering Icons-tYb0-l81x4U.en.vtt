One thing that's great about Create React Native App,

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:06.540
is it has built in support for icons.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.570
So what you can do is any icon that's found

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.660
in any of these icon sets, whether it's fontawesome,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.375
ionicons, materialicons, any of these,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:19.829
we have access to those by default with create react native app.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.239
If you want to explore all of the icons you can use,

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:24.834
you can head to this url.

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:27.775
So say we wanted, I don't know if there's going to be,

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:29.519
there is a pizza one. All right, perfect.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.909
So say we wanted to use this ionicon's pizza icon inside our application.

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:39.000
How we would do that, is we would head over to our app and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.134
we would import and ionicons from,

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:51.140
@expo/vector-icons and then now when we render this Ionicons component,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.719
the name we give it is going to be associated with

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.274
the specific icon we want to use in the ionicons library.

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:04.799
So what we can do is just copy ios-pizza and paste that in there.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.125
We also have a few other options.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:09.795
We can come in here and say what color we want it to be.

00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:11.700
Say we want it to be red.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.010
And now when our app refreshes,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.290
both on iOS and Android we get a little red pizza.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.745
And because that's a little small,

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:27.480
what we can do is we can also specify a size and make it a little bit bigger.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.380
So again Create React Native App by default comes with

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:39.349
@expo/vector-icons which then gives you access to all of these icon sets.
