00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.879
When you're building a React Native app,

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.035
sometimes it's hard to know what you can and cannot do.

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:08.539
This is because it's pretty unusual to be writing

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.329
JavaScript to build a native application.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.679
The good news is that,

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.059
React Native itself is fundamentally, still just JavaScript.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:20.750
This means that, if you want to add a JavaScript library like Redux,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.285
you do it exactly the same as if you were developing for the Web.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.839
Now, this doesn't work for everything.

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.765
For example, styling is a little bit different with React Native,

00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:31.655
but for JavaScript libraries,

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:35.189
you'd add them the same way here as you do on the Web.
