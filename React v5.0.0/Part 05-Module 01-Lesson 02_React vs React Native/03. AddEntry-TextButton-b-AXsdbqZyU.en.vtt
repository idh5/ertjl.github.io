00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.049
Now what we want to do is if the user has already logged their information for the day,

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.719
what we want to do is make sure that we show this screen where we say,

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:09.234
"You've already logged your information."

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:12.519
And we give them the option to reset their information.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.609
This is iOS and this is Android over here on the right.

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.839
So the very first thing we'll do is inside of add entry,

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.179
let's go ahead and import a few things.

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.239
First, let's make sure we

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.464
import Ionicons because that's the icon component we'll be using.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:41.070
And then, what we will do is down here inside of our render method is,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.984
let's just say if.this.props.alreadyLogged and we will eventually pass in this as a prop.

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:52.379
But we will set it up right now just so that when we do, it's all ready for us.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.975
So, if we've already logged our information,

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:59.939
then what we want to return is a view inside of this view.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:03.509
Let's go ahead and render our Ionicons icon.

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:12.013
Let's say, ios-happy-outline and then the size we will say 100.

00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:17.055
And then under this we will have a text that says,

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:20.775
"You already logged your information for today."

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:27.155
And then what we want to do is we want to have right here a reset button.

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.885
So that way we can hit this button and it'll reset.

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:32.725
This is going to be a pretty common component.

00:01:32.724 --> 00:01:34.319
You'll notice that this button is right here,

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.144
it's just a text button.

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:38.909
So what we'll do is we will actually create this because we're

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.364
going to use this text button a few other places in our app.

00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:45.149
So let's just call it textbutton.js.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.650
It's going to be a button,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.765
so we'll need a few things,

00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:53.855
text as well as we'll use TouchableOpacity both coming from React Native.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:56.969
It is going to be a stateless functional component

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.629
and it is going to receive a few different things.

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:04.569
Children. And then onPress.

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.234
We want to return TouchableOpacity onPress,

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:10.760
we're obviously going to call onPress that we're passing in.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.019
And then what we'll do here is we will just render.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.350
"Children", wrapping it in a text component.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.400
So, now, inside of add entry,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.265
let's go ahead and import that and then now what we want to do is down here,

00:02:26.264 --> 00:02:31.154
right here, let's go ahead and render our text button.

00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:36.824
Inside of it, let's just go ahead and say reset and then now what we need to do,

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:40.254
we need to pass it a method to run whenever it's clicked.

00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:46.074
So what we can do is let's go ahead and add a reset method here.

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:49.544
We will grab the key for today,

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.649
which again we can get by calling timeToString.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.965
And then again, what we're going to do,

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.340
just like we're doing up here in submit,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.240
eventually, we'll do a few other things.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.365
Let's just make a note to ourselves,

00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:03.870
so we want to update Redux.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.420
We then want to route to home and we then want to update our database.

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.064
So all of those we will do in a future lesson.

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:19.979
But now we have reset that we can then pass to our text button component.

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.179
So now this looks good,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.650
just to test this is working,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.030
instead of saying, if this.props.alreadyLogged let's just change this to true.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.870
Looks like we have a syntax error on line 90,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.860
that should be equals.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.490
And it looks like we are getting another issue where we probably have

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.240
a typo name ios-happy-outline. There we go.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.365
Alright, so we have this view.

00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:50.495
Now when we hit reset nothing happens,

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:53.000
but eventually it will happen.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.189
So let's just go ahead before we end and change this back to this.props.alreadyLogged.
