00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
What I want to talk about in this video is how we can actually show

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.424
an image to the view inside of react-native.

00:00:06.424 --> 00:00:08.769
Typically, there are two ways that you display

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.424
an image or there are two different sources where you get the image.

00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:14.339
The first one is just with a local filer here.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.464
So this time I'm going to stop PNG.

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:21.429
And the second way is if this file or this image was hosted on a server somewhere.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.140
So I'll show you how to implement both of those.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.835
Let's go ahead and do the first one first.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:32.410
This local file. What we need to do is grab the Image component,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.434
and now we render it just as we would

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:37.370
any other component and it takes a few different props.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:42.250
I'm going to go ahead and give it a style prop of styles.img which is just down here.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.435
We give it a width and height of 100 and a border radius of 50.

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:49.120
And then next, we actually need to give it the source.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:52.780
So what we do for local files is we use

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.575
require and then just pass in the path to the specific file.

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:00.490
So you notice here our App.JS File is in

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.454
the same level or the same hierarchy as this image.

00:01:04.454 --> 00:01:06.834
So we can access the image or we can require it

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:10.159
just by using.slash and then the name of the image.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.009
So now, if we look at our apps,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.560
you'll notice both of them have this image.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.189
And now, say we wanted to add an image from an external source,

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.670
so an image that's hosted somewhere.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.555
What I'm going to do is just add a view to add some spacing real quick.

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:29.000
And then now, in order to get the image that is hosted somewhere else,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.629
what we'll do the same thing.

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:32.375
Let's add a style.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:36.640
But now, instead of passing in a require invocation here,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.340
what we're going to do is we'll pass in an object which has

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.159
a URI property and then the value of

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.099
this is going to be the specific URL where the image is being hosted at.

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.609
Which in this case is on tylermcginnis.com So now,

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.644
what will happen when our apps refresh,

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:56.254
you'll notice that we get two different images.

00:01:56.254 --> 00:02:02.000
One is living locally inside of our app and the other is living on a server somewhere.
