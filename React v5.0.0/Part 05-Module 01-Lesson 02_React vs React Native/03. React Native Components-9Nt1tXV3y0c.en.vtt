00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.254
When you're developing for the web,

00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:07.205
you automatically have access to every element in the HTML specification.

00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:09.695
This includes elements like div and span.

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:12.365
In React Native, it is similar,

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:15.964
except instead of using elements provided by the HTML spec,

00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:19.448
you'll use components provided by React Native.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.945
Components like view and text.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:23.870
In this lesson, we'll be covering some of

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.365
the most common React Native components you might come across.

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:31.939
Some of these we'll use in the Udacity fitness project, others we won't.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.289
But they're all good to know.
