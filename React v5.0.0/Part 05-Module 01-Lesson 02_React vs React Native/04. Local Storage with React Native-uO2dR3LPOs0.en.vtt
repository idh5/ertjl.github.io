00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.599
React Native's version of LocalStorage is called AsyncStorage.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:08.339
It's similar to LocalStorage, except it's asynchronous.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.589
What's nice about AsyncStorage is it's

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.780
a JavaScript abstraction over the iOS and Android equivalents.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.160
So when using it, you don't need to worry about the different environments.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.009
Similar to LocalStorage, AsyncStorage has three main methods: set item,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.000
remove item, and clear all.
