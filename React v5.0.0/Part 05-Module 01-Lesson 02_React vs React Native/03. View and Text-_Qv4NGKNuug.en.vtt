The two most fundamental components in React Native are View and Text.

00:00:05.794 --> 00:00:10.370
And we can see both of these in the sample app that Create React Native gives us.

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.969
What's cool about View is It's going to map directly to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.780
the native equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.150
So on Android, it's going to map to android.view,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.379
and on iOS, it's going to map to ui.view.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:29.224
You can kind of think of View the same way you would think of div on the web.

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:31.865
And one tricky thing that might take time to get used to,

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.530
is typically on the web,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.820
you'll do something like this,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.149
where you have a paragraph,

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.729
and you'll have some text inside of it,

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:39.730
or sometimes, you'll even have a div,

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:42.039
with some text inside of it.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.490
But with React Native,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.625
you need to make sure that when ever you have text,

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:50.789
that you wrap that text inside of the text component.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.295
If you don't do that,

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:55.020
what's going to happen when you try to run your app?

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080
As noticed, you'll get an error here saying,

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.814
raw text, open up app.

00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:00.195
Start working on your app.

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:03.590
Basically, it's saying this section right here,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.000
isn't wrapped inside of a text component.
