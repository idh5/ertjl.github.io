00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.889
In this program, you'll work alongside Tyler to build a number of React applications.

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:08.535
These are projects that you'll build in class while learning React.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:12.900
Here at Udacity, we can't stress enough the importance of learning by doing.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.105
So in addition to the in-class projects,

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.035
you'll also be given some projects that you'll build on your own.

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:20.335
These projects will prove how much you've learned.

00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:23.830
For the first project, you'll build an application called My Reads.

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.125
This app will require you to manage state,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.899
build components and leverage React Router.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.515
This project is all about mastering the fundamentals of React.

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:34.600
By fundamentals I mean the stuff you'll be doing

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.135
in every single React project you create.

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:41.259
Check out the following sections for a more in-depth look at what you'll be building.
