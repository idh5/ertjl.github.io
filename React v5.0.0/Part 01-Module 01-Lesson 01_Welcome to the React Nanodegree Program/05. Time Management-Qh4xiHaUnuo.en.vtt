00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
The single biggest contributor to student success in

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
our Nanodegree programs is time commitment.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.525
The first Nanodegree graduate at Udacity didn't have any prior experience.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:12.612
He simply worked hard and put in time consistently,

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:16.189
making his Nanodegree a part of his daily and weekly schedule.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.540
The timeline you're operating on assumes that you'll work on

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.535
your Nanodegree program for 12 hours a week.

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:25.394
Since many students have a lot of other things going on in their lives, like jobs,

00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:27.300
families or other big commitments,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.429
it's really important to block out time on

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.490
your calendar every week for your Nanodegree program.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.905
While binge working works well for some people,

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:36.960
the most successful Udacity students work on

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.704
their courses and projects multiple times a week,

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:41.085
not just in one big chunk.

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:44.219
And a 12 hour chunk would be really exhausting.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.814
Learning and working out a schedule time helps what you're learning stick better,

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:51.119
since you're thinking about it more frequently.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:55.323
On top of that, working at about the same time each week can really be helpful,

00:00:55.323 --> 00:00:57.429
because after you do it for a few times,

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.429
it really just feels like second nature.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.659
So I want you to go to your calendar right now and schedule recurring study times.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.750
Remember to plan for a possible delays and long debugging times

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.284
and make sure to give yourself enough time for the project planning stage.

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:13.219
That way, you can decrease stress and stay on track.
