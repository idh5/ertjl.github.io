Hi. I'm Tyler.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.275
Welcome to the React Nanodegree program.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:05.880
What makes React really great,

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.910
is it changes how you think about creating web applications.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.595
Not only will React make you a better developer,

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:16.560
but it will also open up other development platforms like native phone development or VR.

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:19.394
React is being used by the largest companies in the world,

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.000
as well as small startups.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.355
It was built by the engineers who work on Facebook,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.080
one of the world's largest websites,

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.509
but it also scales to projects of any size.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.810
React eliminates a lot of the friction in building a user interface.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.574
If you declare the UI with encapsulated components that manage their own state,

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:39.255
then you compose those smaller pieces together into a full application.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:44.475
In this program, your first project will be a React app that manages a list of contacts.

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:48.885
It will communicate with a remote server to add and remove people from the list.

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:51.405
You'll also be able to filter it in the browser.

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:53.250
You'll be building this app from scratch

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.289
along with me in the first course of the program.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.060
After completing this program,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.980
you'll be positioned to take full advantage of

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.250
the changing web development landscape that React is ushering in.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.140
With this Nanodegree program,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.320
you'll receive expert code review on your projects and of course,

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.404
Udacity's best in class instruction.

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:12.299
