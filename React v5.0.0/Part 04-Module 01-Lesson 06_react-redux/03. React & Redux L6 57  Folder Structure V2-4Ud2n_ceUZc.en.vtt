00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
The code in our project is all located in one file.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.804
This has been nice for learning purposes,

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:09.314
but it's obviously not the best approach for a real-world app.

00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:12.509
Let's refactor our app to use Create-React-App,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.429
so we can see one approach to folder structure with React and Redux.
