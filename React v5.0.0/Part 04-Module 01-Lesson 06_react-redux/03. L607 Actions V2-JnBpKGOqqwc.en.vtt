00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
So, now we want to start migrating some

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:07.349
of our code over here to our actual React Application.

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.259
So, we're going to use what is called the real-style folder structure for this.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.130
So, we'll have a components folder that has all of our components in it.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.660
And then we'll also have a Actions folder as well as a Reducers folder.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.228
So, first to go ahead and move over all of our actions.

00:00:24.228 --> 00:00:26.300
So, the first thing I want to do is create

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.530
a brand new folder inside our source called Actions.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.609
And now, we're going to have three different files inside of this,

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.479
a todos.js file for all of our Todos Actions,

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.074
a goals.js file for all of our Goals Actions,

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:44.540
and then a share.js file for all of our actions that

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.170
are shared across a few different reducers.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.700
So first, let's go and let's start with our,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.250
let's see what we have here, let's start with our Todos Reducer.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.923
So, the first thing we want to do is bring over all of our constants.

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:02.560
Add Todo, Remove Todo as well as Toggle Todo.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.070
So, these are going to be created inside of

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:12.159
our Actions folder but what we also want to do is we want to Export them,

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.429
so that we can then Import them inside of our Reducers folder.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.925
So that we can lessen for these specific Action types.

00:01:18.924 --> 00:01:20.950
So, now what we want to do is,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.924
let's go ahead and move over our Action Creators.

00:01:23.924 --> 00:01:28.459
So, we have our Add Todo action as well as Remove Todo action and Toggle Todo action.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.419
So, we'll first bring those over and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.710
typically what you do is you don't need to append action onto here,

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.814
I was just doing that to avoid collisions in our single file.

00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:42.829
So, we can just have Add Todo, Remove Todo as well as Toggle Todo.

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.569
Then we need a Asynchronous Action Creators which will be

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.569
Handle Todo and Add Todo as well as Handle Delete Todo and Handle Toggle.

00:01:53.569 --> 00:02:00.779
So, let's copy these over here and we'll fix the indention.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.765
And then now, what we've done is,

00:02:04.765 --> 00:02:07.584
instead of Add Todo action it's just Add Todo.

00:02:07.584 --> 00:02:09.849
Same thing with Remove Todo action.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:18.199
So, we can update all of these and then this is just Toggle Todo,

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.329
so we should have no more action there we go.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.065
Alright, so now what we want to do is we want to Export

00:02:26.064 --> 00:02:28.629
the three Action Creators that we are

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.394
going to be using in our other files, in our other modules.

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:36.850
That's going to be our Handle Add Todo Action Creator.

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.074
As well as Handle Delete Todo and also Handle Toggle because these are

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:46.299
our Action Creators which are really encapsulating all of

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.199
the other Non-Asynchronous Action Creators up here.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.330
So, the only other thing we need to do is you'll notice

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.280
that inside of our Async Action Creators,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.669
we're using our API.

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:01.844
So, we can Import that from Goals Todos API which we installed in the last video.

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:04.650
So, now AddTodo.js file looks pretty good.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.159
Let's go ahead and do the exact same thing for our Goals.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.549
So, we want to do Add Goal and Remove Goal

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.670
grab both of those and again we want to Export both of these.

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.509
Then we want to grab all of our Action Creators.

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.509
So, Add Goal action as well as

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:29.039
our Removal Goal action and we don't need to Export these because we're not

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.789
using them in any other files but we do want

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:37.064
to Export our two Asynchronous Action Creators.

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:41.250
Which are going to be these two right here,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.110
handledDeleteGoal as well as handleAddGoal and then we need to adjust

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.310
these instead of being Add Goal Action we

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.717
have just Add Goal and then this is just going to be Remove Goal.

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:58.949
We're just removing the word action from the end of the text unnecessary.

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.814
Then we need to export both of these functions

00:04:01.814 --> 00:04:04.897
because we're going to import them inside of our components.

00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:12.729
And then finally, we need to import our API which is coming from Goals Todos API and

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:17.152
then the last code that we want to bring over is going to go in this shared code and

00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:23.515
what we have is our Received Data Constant,

00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:30.789
our Receive Data Action Creator here,

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.860
we can remove the word action from that.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.480
And then finally, our

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.960
handleInitialData Action Creator which is what we are going to be exporting.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:44.069
And then we can adjust this to just be Received

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.959
Data and then finally as we've done before a few different times,

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.639
now we want to import our API.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:57.459
So, now what we've done is, we've taken all of the actions out of our index.html

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:59.799
file over here and we've put them into

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.000
their own actions folder inside of our React application.
