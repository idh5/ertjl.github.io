00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
So now we have actions,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.419
our middleware as well as our reducers.

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.889
Let's go ahead and migrate our components over to our new React app.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.419
So inside of our components folder we're going to create three new files.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:21.000
We'll have Goals.js, List.js for our list component, and then Todos.js.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.684
And so now, let's do our List component first.

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:29.144
So, I'm just going to copy this and paste it over inside,

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:30.179
not inside of Todos,

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.990
but inside of our List.js file,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.840
and this is going to be the default export as we're used to with React components.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.300
And then, because we are using jsx in this module,

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.759
we need to go ahead and import React.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.519
Next, let's move over our Todos Component.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.109
So, let's grab all of this both our Todos Component

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.159
as well as our connect invocation to connect our Todos Component.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.019
So we'll paste that into here.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.895
And then, now you'll notice that we are using

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:02.390
a few different action creators as well as connect that down here.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.254
So we need to go ahead and import everything we need.

00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:08.609
So first we will grab React from react,

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:12.554
then we want to grab connect from react-redux.

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:17.189
And then now, we want to grab all of the different action creators that we will be using,

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.855
so we'll have handeAddTodo as well as handleDeleteTodo, and handleToggle.

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:26.159
All of those are going to be coming from actions/todos.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.390
So now, instead of creating a ConnectedTodos variable here,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.998
what we can do is

00:01:32.998 --> 00:01:38.189
just default as just export as the default export the invocation of connect.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.679
So that way, whenever we import this Todos module,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.175
what we're going to get back is our ConnectedTodos Component,

00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:48.944
by using the connect function coming from react-redux.

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:51.765
And now we forgot that inside of our Todos Component,

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:54.420
when I say we, I mean I, we are also rendering List.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.570
So we need to go ahead and import List as well.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.719
And now, our Todos component is all finished.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.325
So now, the last one we want to move over is our Goals Component.

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.069
So, let's go and grab that over here.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.707
We will also grab the ConnectedGoals Component,

00:02:11.707 --> 00:02:13.169
and then just as we did before,

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.959
we need to go ahead and import a few different things. So we need React.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.469
We again need connect,

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.639
because we want to export the connected components.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.569
And then finally, we need List,

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.388
and now finally because we need some action creators here,

00:02:31.388 --> 00:02:34.210
handleAddGoal as well as handleDeleteGoal,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.580
which are both going to be coming from action/goals.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.260
So, now this looks good. The only other change we need to make is again,

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:50.629
we want to export our connect invocation as the default export.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:55.844
And then now, inside of the app.js,

00:02:55.844 --> 00:02:57.284
we need to go ahead and update this.

00:02:57.284 --> 00:03:00.259
Let's bring this over as well.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:07.439
So we will grab our connected app as well as our normal app component.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:13.379
And then, we need to import a few different things here. We'll grab React.

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.329
We want to import ConnectedTodos coming from our Todos module.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.710
We also want to grab ConnectedGoals coming from Goals.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.000
We want to grab connect coming from react-redux,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.724
and then the only action creator we need to grab is going to be handleInitialData,

00:03:35.724 --> 00:03:40.569
which is going to come from actions/shared.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.079
All right. So, now instead of doing this,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.910
what we want to do is say export default connect.

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.159
And then now we're looking pretty good.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.079
The only other code that we need to bring over is everything to do

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.340
with creating our store and adding that as a Provider when we call reactDOM.render.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.080
So, that's what we'll be doing in the next video.
