00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
As you've seen, Redux has no relation to react.

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.509
React just like any other UI library,

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.900
can leverage Redux for more predictable state management.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.019
Looking at our own implementation of react and Redux together,

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.990
the real key is that we're passing down our store as a prop,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.690
and utilizing it to get state dispatch or subscribe whenever we need to.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.880
If you were tasked with building a library to extract some of

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.234
the rough patches in our implementation between react and Redux,

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:29.085
how might you do it?

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:31.125
When we wrote the createStore function,

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:33.270
our store is responsible for three things,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.330
getting state, updating state,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.114
and listening for changes.

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:40.980
The whole goal of our abstraction should be making

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.519
these three things work as seamlessly with react as possible.
