00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Now that we've moved over our actions from our

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.919
index.html file over to this actions folder,

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.259
the next thing we want to do is move over our reducers.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.105
So inside of this reducers folder we are going to have four different files.

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:17.644
So we will have todos.js for our todos reducer,

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:20.475
goals for our goals reducer.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:24.815
We also have a loading reducer so we'll have a loading.js file.

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:27.580
And then we will have an index.js file which is going to

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.179
use combined reducers and export the invocation of that,

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.689
parsing at all of our reducers which we will see here in a second.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:40.789
So first, let's go ahead and move over our todos reducer.

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.630
And whenever I create a new reducers file what I have is,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.795
as the default export we are exporting todos or the specific reducer.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:55.734
And then now what we need to do is we need to import all of

00:00:55.734 --> 00:01:00.149
these different action types that we're using from our actions folder.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.394
So what we'll do is we will grab ADD_ TODO, REMOVE_TODO,

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:06.085
as well as TOGGLE_TODO,

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:10.034
and all of those are going to be coming from actions/todos.

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:11.784
So now this file looks good.

00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:13.709
We have all of our action types.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:17.861
And then we are exporting as the default export our todos reducer.

00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:21.234
So let's do the exact same thing for our goals reducer.

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:23.859
So we'll come over here and copy it.

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.528
And now this is going to be the default export.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:34.545
And then the different action types that we need to

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:37.814
import are going to be ADD_GOAL as well as REMOVE_GOAL

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:43.909
which are going to come from actions/goals. Looks good.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.715
And now for our loading reducer,

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:51.109
we can follow the exact same pattern here. We paste this over.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:56.120
This is going to be the default export and the action type

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.745
that we need is going to be RECEIVE_DATA which is coming from actions/shared.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:06.109
And then the very last thing we need to do is with our index.js file.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.004
And if you'll remember, when we create our store,

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.099
what we're doing is we call Redux.createStore.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.909
And then we parse it an invocation of combined middleware.

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.889
So what we'll do is we want our index.js file

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.069
to handle this combined middleware invocation,

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.590
so that way when we import the export from this index.js file what we're getting is

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.319
our reducer rather than having to do that in our

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.530
main index.js file eventually when we create our store.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.330
So what we'll do is we want to import combined reducers coming from

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.631
Redux and then we want to import our different reducers which we just barely made.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:51.340
So we have todos as well as loading and last we have our goals reducer.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.020
And what we want to export as the default export

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.659
is an invocation of combineReducers just as we're doing over here,

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.270
passing it through properties todos,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.270
loading, as well as goals.
