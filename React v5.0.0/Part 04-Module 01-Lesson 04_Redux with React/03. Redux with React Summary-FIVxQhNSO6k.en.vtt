00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.329
In this lesson, we learned about how we can add react to

00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:07.580
a Redux application by passing down the Redux Store as props.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.425
At this point, all of the data in our app is local.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:12.420
That isn't really realistic.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.969
In the next lesson, we'll take a look at how Redux handles

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.260
asynchronous data by moving our local data to an external API.
