00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
You're probably familiar with the idea of functions,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.230
when to use a function and when not to use one probably comes pretty naturally to you.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.780
One of the best parts about React is that you can

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.352
use the same intuitions that you have about functions,

00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:14.490
for when to create React components.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.943
However, instead of your function taking in some arguments and returning a value,

00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:22.919
your function is going to take in some arguments and return some UI.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.485
Now, let's take a look at some code.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:29.743
Here we have three functions and one function invocation.

00:00:29.743 --> 00:00:31.964
You'll notice our code is clean and organized

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.524
because each function has a specific purpose.

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:37.250
We're composing our functions together by having

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.009
one function getProfiledData leverage

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.939
the other two functions, getProfilePic and getProfileLink.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.759
Now, when we invoke getProfileData,

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.879
we'll get back an object which represents our user.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.615
Now, instead of having these functions return an object with data,

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.495
let's modify them a bit to return some UI.

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:58.954
Now, don't freak out about this syntax,

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:02.045
we're going to cover this code much more in depth in future lessons.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:04.549
But for now, notice that with React,

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.325
instead of composing functions to get some values,

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:10.079
we're composing functions to get some UI.
