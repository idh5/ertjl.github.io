00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
The next couple of exercises will give you some hands on

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.325
experience with a few different HTTP requests.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:09.355
You need to determine if the request is preflighted or not.

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:10.845
And if it is preflighted,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.926
which line causes it to be preflighted?

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:18.298
So launch the server and then reconstruct this request in the fetch tool.

00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:21.655
Use Dev tools to see that some requests are executed right away,

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.030
while others send a preflight request.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.545
You'll know it's been preflighted if it uses the "Options" method.

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:29.830
Play around with the requests until you figure out

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.950
what makes the browser preflight the request.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.855
If the method "GET" line causes the request to be preflighted, then check here.

00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:41.000
If the request isn't provided at all, then check here.
