00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.662
I've logged into the bank,

00:00:01.662 --> 00:00:04.370
so the login cookie is set in my browser.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.680
Opening up dev tools,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.475
I can see the cookie here.

00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:11.430
Now I need to create a website that will send the forged request.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.185
If someone stumbles upon my site,

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:15.942
I want them to think they're going to play a game.

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:17.340
When they click this button.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.985
I want to request to be sent off to the banks transfer URL.

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:24.765
The transfer URL is expecting a POST request.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:26.760
The body of the request needs to be

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.400
the recipient and the amount of money being transferred.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.430
Since this is a POST request,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.270
the content type header has to be set to this value.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.950
Now this code will send a request,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.400
but the bank's website checks for a specific cookie.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.225
Credentials include, "Sends along cookies for this domain."

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:47.895
If the user is already logged into the bank,

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:49.980
then the browser has a login cookie and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.580
automatically includes it when the request is sent.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.365
Lastly, when someone clicks on a button,

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:57.855
I'll change the button text to this encouraging message.

00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:00.570
All right, let's try it out. Clicking the button

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.015
changes the text, so something has happened.

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:06.365
In dev tools, I can see the request that just got sent.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.555
And here's the cookie that got set in the other tab.

00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:11.455
Refreshing the bank site,

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:13.925
I see this new entry, it's worked.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:16.770
And here's the code that the quiz is looking for.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.040
This was an involved exercise, so great job!
