00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.925
Here's the URL that I need to hit on the decoder site.

00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:07.570
Now I need to set the keys value to the session ID cookie.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.535
Document.cookie gets all of the cookies.

00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:15.240
Then I'll split on the equal sign and I'll get the cookies value.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.740
This code is rather naive and assumes that the session ID cookie is the very first one,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.580
which it is in this case.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.420
Here's a more robust version that first searches for a session ID.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.800
So this is the javascript I'll use.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.300
So this is the full URL.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.555
Since this form is vulnerable to cross-site scripting,

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:37.340
I just need to wrap this in script tags.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.455
Sending this value gives me the passphrase.

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:42.045
Since we're talking about security,

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.325
you should search Google for this passphrase.

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:46.200
It deals with another security vulnerability.
