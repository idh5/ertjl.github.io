00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
The server for this project has two endpoints,

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.240
a badwebsite URL and a decoder URL.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.920
The badwebsite page has a form that is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.290
You need to exploit this vulnerability by

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.395
sending this site's cookie to the decoder website.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:17.970
To complete this quiz,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.740
create a fetch request using this URL,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.550
but you need to use JavaScript to set

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.570
the key to the value of the badwebsite's SESSION_ID cookie.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.370
If you did everything correctly,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.210
the server will give you a passphrase.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.980
And that's the server, not the browser's console, so check the terminal.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.470
Enter that passphrase here.
