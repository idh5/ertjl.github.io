00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.013
Sending this request shows the "OPTIONS" method,

00:00:03.013 --> 00:00:04.685
so it's been preflighted.

00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:07.470
If I delete the header and send the request again,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.765
it's still been preflighted.

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:12.930
If I add the header back in and change the method to

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.707
something I know isn't preflighted like "GET",

00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:19.270
then it doesn't use the options header.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.455
So the "ACCEPT" header doesn't cause a preflight,

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.940
but the "PUT" method does.
