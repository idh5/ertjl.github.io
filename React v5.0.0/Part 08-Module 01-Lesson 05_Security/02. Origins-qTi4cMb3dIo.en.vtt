00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
As a general rule of thumb,

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.564
JavaScript is not allowed to access the data of any other origin than its own.

00:00:06.564 --> 00:00:09.645
An origin is made up of three parts: the data scheme,

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:11.475
the host name, and the port.

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:13.330
For the page you're on right now,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.910
the scheme is HTTPS,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.255
the Host name is www.udacity.com,

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:20.580
and the port is 443.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.770
If you change any of these parts,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.250
you are on a different origin and different rules will apply.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.560
Apart from the mixed content problems we talked about,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.790
earlier this is another reason to not mix HTTP and HTTPS URLs.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.885
But what are these rules that apply once you are working across multiple origins?

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:43.145
First of all, you can't make fetch requests to other origins.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.925
Actually, under certain criteria,

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:48.090
you can, but then you can't read the answer.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.520
Secondly, you cannot inspect eye frames or

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.040
windows with JavaScript if they are from another origin.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.970
These rules make a lot of sense if you think about it.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.680
Let's assume I was allowed to make fetch requests to other origins.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.590
I could just set up a website that makes fetch requests to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.635
Facebook.com and steal all your Facebook messages,

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:09.080
or even worse, I could make fetch request to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.185
udacity.com and make you drop out of all of your Udacity classes.

00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:14.980
No, we don't want that.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.380
This restriction or rule is called the same origin policy.
