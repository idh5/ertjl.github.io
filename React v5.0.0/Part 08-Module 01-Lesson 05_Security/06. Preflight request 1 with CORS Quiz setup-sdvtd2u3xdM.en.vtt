00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Since this request is identical to the request I want to send,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.161
I'm not going to change anything.

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:09.601
I need to see which method is used,

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:13.885
so I'll turn off some of these other distracting columns and turn on the method column.

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:16.690
This GET request was sent successfully

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.163
and since there isn't an options request listed here,

00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:21.280
this request was not preflighted.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.000
So this is the correct answer.
