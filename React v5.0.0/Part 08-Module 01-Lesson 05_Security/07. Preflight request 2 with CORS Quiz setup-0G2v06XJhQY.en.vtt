00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Just like the previous quiz,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.965
you need to determine if the request is pre-flighted or not.

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:09.715
And if it is pre-flighted, which line or lines causes it to be pre-flighted.

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:14.780
If the method POST line causes this request be pre-flighted, then check here.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.450
If the X-Forwarded-For line is the culprit, then check here.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.120
If the request isn't pre-flighted at all, then check here.
