00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Thanks for coming back. Now, you might be asking yourself,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.120
why are we talking about security again?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.840
I mean, we've already talked about TLS and its use in HTTPS.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.160
HTTPS covers many angles of attack for things

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.965
like eavesdropping on your traffic or just impersonating the web server as a whole.

00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:17.730
However, the most secure front door in the world will not

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.740
be worth anything if there's a letter to the first floor window.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.425
The letter, being your web app.

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.425
HTTP contains some very subtle security risk.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:29.760
On top of that, the history and backwards compatibility of the HTTP protocol

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.890
carries a lot of baggage from a time where

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.045
security wasn't as big of a topic as it is now.

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:37.830
In this lesson, we are going to learn how certain design choices

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.590
could have allowed an attacker to steal sensitive data and how you,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.470
as a web developer, can protect a web app against such attacks.
