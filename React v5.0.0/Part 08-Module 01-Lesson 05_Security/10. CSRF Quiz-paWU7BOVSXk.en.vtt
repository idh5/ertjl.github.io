00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Do you remember that fictional bank we talked

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.650
about with the exploitable money transfer form.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.685
Well, it's real and we want you to exploit its weakness.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:11.935
The server for this project has two endpoints a banks

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:15.795
website and an evil URL where you'll be able to place your code.

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:19.795
The bank's URL gives us the log in page for the bank's website.

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:23.660
The password is super secret password and it's listed in the instructions.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.820
Here's the bank's beautifully designed balance page.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.100
My sister is coming to town,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.995
so she'll need some spending money.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:35.250
What you need to do is send the Umbrella Corporation 666 units,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.370
but you can't just do it here on this site.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.535
The other URL is the evil site.

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:42.780
This site hosts anything you put in the evil directory,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
so you need to create a website that will send a CRF request to the bank.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.785
This quiz will take a number of steps to complete,

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:52.530
but you're hocking a fake bank, so it's awesome.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.760
You need to sign into the bank's website that

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.885
that evil website will have access to your logging cookie.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:02.820
Then create a website in the evil folder that will send a post request to this URL.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.280
The posted data needs to set the recipient to umbrella core and the amount to 666.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.565
To send along the cookie data in effect request,

00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:14.630
the credentials flag needs to be set to include.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.055
If you do everything correctly the server will give you a token.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:20.710
Now that's the server not the browser's console,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.915
so check the terminal,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.880
then enter that token here.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.885
This exercise is larger than most.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.870
Just take it step by step and make sure fetch request is accurate.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.000
Check in the instruction notes for helping constructing a post request with fetch.
