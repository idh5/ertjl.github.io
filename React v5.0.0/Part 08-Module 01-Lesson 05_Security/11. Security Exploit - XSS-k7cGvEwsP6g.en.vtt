Whenever a website shows user input,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.960
you need to be careful and vigilant.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.060
The users input can be anything and it is

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.315
your responsibility to make sure it won't break your site.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:11.820
A clueless user might break it by accident.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.545
An evil attacker might exploit this flaw and make your website

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:17.445
do things that it did not intend at all.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.550
Not validating user input is one of the oldest vulnerabilities on

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.075
the web and it's called cross-site scripting or XSS for short.

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:27.940
The name comes from the fact that JavaScript can be inject into another site but

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.067
gets executed and has access to all of that site's data.

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:34.320
A typical example is a website that

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.535
asks for a users name when they want to leave a comment.

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:39.645
If this input is not validated,

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:44.445
a user's name can be crafted in such a way that it contains JavaScript code.

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:48.030
That means that every user reading that comment will only see

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.920
the name but the code will be executed without the users knowledge.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.276
In the grand scheme of things,

00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:57.360
this example here is a rather harmless but the script has

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.875
access to all of the site's data including the DOM and Cookies.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:03.980
It could even make fetch requests from the site's origin.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.185
A well crafted XSS exploit can be detrimental.

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:10.665
The only way you can secure yourself against these kinds of attacks

00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:14.520
is to follow a golden rule that always applies in software engineering.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.000
Validate your user's inputs server site.
