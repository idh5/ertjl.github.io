00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.601
And with that we are done with this course.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:05.985
Making a server and a client communicate with each other, Isn't that hard.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:07.370
But doing it correctly,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.445
efficiently and securely is a much more complex task than it might seem.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.740
We have covered a lot of topics in this course.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.950
We've taken a look at the request and response cycle,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.550
where the browser and the server get connected with each other.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.415
Then we looked at HTTP's verbs,

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:23.160
headers, rest, and performance issues.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.690
Lesson three was on HTTPS, TLS, and cryptography.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.095
In the last lesson,

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:32.535
we looked at HTTP/2 and all the amazing benefits it brings to the web ecosystem.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:36.415
In this lesson, we look at security precautions with the same origin policy,

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:38.580
way to get around that policy and then

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.810
some vulnerabilities like C serve and cross site scripting.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.350
We covered a lot of techniques but

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.660
the important thing to keep in mind throughout all of this,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.370
is keeping your users secure.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.270
Thanks for joining us on this journey of clients over communication. We'll see you later.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.000
Bye.
