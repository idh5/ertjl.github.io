00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
Running this request shows the OPTIONS method.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.815
So, I know it's been preflighted,

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:05.940
but I don't know if it's because it's

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.020
the "POST" request or if it's from the "X-Forwarded-For" header.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.760
If I delete this header,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.125
and rerun the request,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.193
it doesn't use the options header.

00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:20.330
So I know that the X-Forwarded-For header caused the request to be preflighted.
