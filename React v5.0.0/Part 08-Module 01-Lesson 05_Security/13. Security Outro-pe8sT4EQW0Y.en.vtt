00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.375
Security is not an easy subject.

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:04.470
And the issues we covered in this lesson are

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.315
not sufficiently fixable on just the front and.

00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:10.500
Your back end, whatever it is needs to implant validation as

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.080
well to be properly secured against C-surf and cross site scripting attacks.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.815
What you have learned here is how to spot

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:20.730
potential vulnerabilities and how to verify if they are exploitable.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.385
Whenever you're about to add any kind of input field in your Webapp,

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:26.290
you should immediately start thinking about cross site scripting and

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.235
C-surf and whether there are potential risks that need to be mitigated.

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:33.000
You'll do yourself and your users a big favor.
